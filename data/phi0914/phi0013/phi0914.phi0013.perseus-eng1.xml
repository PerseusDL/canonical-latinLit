                    and <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 467</note>
                    Quintus Fabius were elected consuls. This was that 467 Fabius who had been the
                    sole survivor of his family destroyed at the Cremera. <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified">See 2.1. 11.</note>
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In his former consulship Aemilius had already
                    supported the assignment of land to the plebs. Consequently, when he entered a
                    second time upon the office, not only had the agrarians begun to have hopes of a
                    law, but the tribunes, who had often tried to carry the measure against the
                    opposition of the consuls, now took it up in the belief that with the
                    co-operation of a consul it could certainly be made good; and the consul
                    continued of the same mind. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The possessors of
                    the land, comprising a large proportion of the patricians, complained that the
                    head of the state was openly supporting tribunician policies and making himself
                    popular by a generosity exhibited at other men's expense; they thus diverted the
                    resentment awakened by the whole affair from the tribunes to the consul.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A bitter struggle was impending, when
                    Fabius, by a proposal which neither side found injurious, set the <pb n="p.5"/>
                    matter right. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Under the leadership and
                    auspices of <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        467</note> Titus Quinctius, as he pointed out, a considerable territory had
                    been conquered the year before from the Volsci; Antium, a well-situated maritime
                    city, could be made the seat of a colony; in this way the plebs would obtain
                    farms without causing the landholders to complain, and the state would be at
                    harmony. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This suggestion was adopted.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As commissioners for distributing the land
                    Fabius appointed Titus Quinctius, Aulus Verginius, and Publius Furius, and it
                    was ordered that those who wished to receive grants should give in their names.
                    There at once appeared the fastidiousness which usually attends abundance, and
                    so few persons enrolled that Volscian colonists were added to fill out the
                    number; the rest of the populace preferred demanding land at Rome to receiving
                    it elsewhere. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The Aequi begged Quintus Fabius,
                    who had invaded their country, to grant them peace; and broke it themselves by a
                    sudden raid on Latin territory. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Quintus Servilius, being sent against the
                    Aequi <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        466-465</note> in the following year —when he and Spurius Postumius were
                    consuls —made a permanent camp in the Latin country, where the army was attacked
                    by a pestilence which deprived it of the power to act. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> The war dragged on into its third year, the consulship of
                    Quintus Fabius and Titus Quinctius. To Fabius was given the command against the
                    Aequi, without the customary drawing of lots, since he had been victorious over
                    them and had granted them peace. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Setting out
                    in the full expectation that the glory of his name would bring the enemy to
                    terms, he sent envoys to their national council and bade them announce that
                    Quintus Fabius the consul said that <pb n="p.7"/> he had brought peace from the
                    Aequi to Rome, and <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        466-465</note> was then bringing war from Rome to the Aequi in the same
                    right hand, now armed, which he had formerly given them in friendship.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Whose faithlessness and perjury were
                    responsible for this, the gods were even then witnesses, and would presently
                    punish the offenders. Yet however that might be, he would himself prefer that
                    the Aequi should even now freely repent, instead of suffering the penalties of
                    war. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> If they did so, they could count on a
                    safe refuge in the clemency they had already proved; but if they rejoiced in
                    perjury, it was rather with the angry gods than with their enemies that they
                    would be at war. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> So far were these words from
                    having the slightest effect on anyone, that the envoys narrowly escaped
                    violation, and an army was dispatched to Algidus against the Romans. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> On the arrival of this news at Rome, the insult,
                    rather than the danger, brought the other consul out from the City. And so two
                    consular armies approached the enemy, drawn up in line of battle, that they
                    might instantly engage them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But since it
                    happened to be near the end of the day, a man called out to them from an outpost
                    of the enemy, <quote> This, Romans, is making a parade of war, not waging it.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When night is about to fall, you draw
                        up your battle-line; we need more hours of daylight for the struggle which
                        is close at hand. To-morrow at sunrise form your battle-line again; there
                        will be opportunity for fighting, never fear! </quote>
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Galled by these words the troops were led
                    back to their camp to await the morrow; the night would be a long one, they
                    felt, that must intervene before the combat. Meanwhile they refreshed themselves
                    with food and <pb n="p.9"/> sleep. When it grew light next morning, the Roman
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 466-465</note>
                    army took the field, some time before the enemy. At last the Aequi too came out.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The battle raged fiercely on both sides,
                    for the Romans fought with exasperation and hatred, while the Aequi were
                    conscious that the danger in which they were involved was due to their own
                    fault, and this, with their despair of ever being trusted again, incited them to
                    the last degree of daring and exertion. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Nevertheless they were unable to withstand the attack of the Romans. And yet,
                    when they had been defeated and had fallen back to their own territory, the
                    warlike soldiers, their spirit as little inclined to peace as ever, complained
                    against their generals for having staked the cause on a pitched battle, a
                    species of fighting in which the Romans excelled; <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> the Aequi, they said, were better at pillaging and raiding,
                    and a number of scattered bands could make war more effectively than the great
                    mass of a single army. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Leaving a garrison, therefore, in their camp,
                    they crossed the Roman border in so headlong an incursion as to carry terror
                    even to the City. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Moreover, the unexpectedness
                    of the inroad added to the alarm, for nothing could have been apprehended less
                    than that an enemy who was defeated and almost shut up in his camp should be
                    thinking of a raid; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and the country people who
                    in their fright came tumbling in through the gates told not of pillaging nor of
                    small bands of raiders, but, exaggerating everything in their senseless fear,
                    cried out that whole armies of the enemy were close at hand and rushing on the
                    City in a serried column. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The very vagueness
                    of these rumours led to further <pb n="p.11"/> exaggeration as the bystanders
                    passed them on to others. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 466-465</note> The running and shouting of men as they
                    called <quote>To arms!</quote> was almost like the panic in a captured city. It
                    chanced that the consul Quinctius had returned from Algidus to Rome. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> This circumstance allayed men's fears, and when the
                    confusion had been stilled, he indignantly reminded them that the enemy they
                    dreaded had been conquered, and posted watches at the gates. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> He then convened the senate, and in accordance with a
                    resolution which the Fathers passed, proclaimed a suspension of the courts.
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The <hi rend="italics"
                            >iustitium</hi> also involved the closing of shops and a general
                        suspension of business. </note>
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After that he set out to defend the frontier,
                    leaving Quintus Servilius as prefect of the City, but did not meet with the
                    enemy in the field. The other consul campaigned with great success. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> Knowing where the enemy would come, he fell upon them
                    when they were weighed down with the booty which incumbered their advancing
                    column, and caused them bitterly to rue their pillaging. But few of them escaped
                    the ambush, and the spoils were all recovered. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    So the suspension of the courts, which had lasted four days, was lifted on the
                    return of the consul Quinctius to the City. </p>
                <p> The census was then taken and Quinctius solemnized the concluding purification.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> There are said to have been registered
                    104,714 citizens, besides orphans and widows. In the Aequian country there was
                    no memorable action after that; the people retired to their towns, and permitted
                    their farms to be burnt and ravaged. The consul made a number of forays with his
                    army throughout the enemy's territory, and returned to Rome with great renown
                    and huge spoils. </p>

                    substitution of one man for another what is really only a matter of names.)

                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There was no doubt but that one consul would
                    make war on the Aequi, and these accordingly appealed to the Ecetranian Volsci
                    for help. It was eagerly granted them —such was the rivalry between these
                    nations in inveterate hatred of Rome —and the most vigorous preparations were
                    made for war. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The Hernici perceived, and
                    warned the Romans, that Ecetra had gone over to the Aequi. Suspicion already
                    rested on the colony of Antium, on the ground that a large body of men, escaping
                    from the place at the time of its capture, had taken refuge with the Aequi;
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> and in fact they fought with the greatest
                    spirit all through the Aequian war; afterwards, when the Aequi had been shut up
                    in their towns, this company dispersed, returned to Antium, and won over the
                    colonists, who were even then at heart disloyal to the Romans. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> The plot was not yet ripe when their proposed defection was
                    reported to the senate, and the consuls were instructed to summon the leaders of
                    the colony to Rome and inquire what was going on. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> These men made no objection to coming, but on being
                    introduced into the senate by the consuls returned such answers to the questions
                    they were asked that they were under a stronger suspicion when dismissed than

                    Spurius Furius, one of the consuls, having received that command, set out
                    against the Aequi. In the country of the Hernici he found the enemy engaged <pb

                    hemmed in and assaulted that not even a messenger could be got off to Rome.

                    blockade of the consul and his army, striking such terror into the hearts of the
                    senators that they passed a decree which has always been held to signify the
                    direst necessity: that Postumius, the other consul, should be commissioned to

                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It was deemed wisest that the consul himself

                    outposts were established before the gates, and troops were posted on the walls;
                    and, as was necessary in the midst of such confusion, the courts were suspended
                    for several days. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In camp meanwhile the consul
                    Furius, having begun by submitting tamely to the blockade, caught the Aequi off
                    their guard, and made a sortie by the decuman gate. <note anchored="true"

                    consul, was carried a good way off by his charge, nor did he observe, in the
                    ardour of pursuit, either that his friends were retiring or that the enemy were
                    moving up to attack him in the rear. His retreat was thus cut off, and after
                    repeated but unsuccessful attempts to force his way back to the camp, he
                    perished, fighting bravely. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The consul too,
                    upon learning that his brother was surrounded, set his face towards the battle
                    and plunged into the midst of the mellay, with more rashness than prudence; for
                    he received a wound, and was barely rescued by the men about him. <milestone

                    the courage of the enemy, who were so inspirited by the death of the lieutenant
                    and the wounding of the consul that from that moment no force could withstand
                    them, and the Romans were driven into their camp and again besieged, being no
                    match for their opponents either in confidence or strength. The very existence
                    of the army would have been imperilled, had not Titus Quinctius come up with the

                    while the besieged, in answer to a signal he had given them from afar, were
                    making a sally from the camp, he intercepted a large body of them. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> There was less carnage but a more headlong rout in
                    the case of the Aequi who were in Roman territory. These men were dispersed and
                    collecting booty when they were attacked by Postumius at several points where he
                    had opportunely stationed troops. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The
                    pillagers, fleeing in a disordered crowd, fell in with Quinctius, who was
                    returning from his victory with the wounded consul; whereupon the consular army
                    splendidly avenged the consul's wound and the slaughter of the lieutenant and
                    his cohorts. Heavy losses were inflicted and sustained on both sides at that

                    specify the totals, saying that the Romans lost five thousand eight hundred in

                    and pillaging within the Roman borders two thousand four hundred were slain by
                    Aulus Postumius, the consul; and that the rest of the expedition, which stumbled
                    upon Quinctius as they were driving off their booty, got off by no means so
                    lightly, for their killed amounted, so he says, with minute particularity, to
                    four thousand two hundred and thirty. </p>

                    when the Hernici reported that the enemy had crossed their borders, they were
                    promptly offered assistance. Two consular armies were enlisted; Veturius was
                    sent to carry the war into the country of the Volsci; <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> while Tricipitinus, having been appointed to secure the
                    territory of the allies from inroads, proceeded no further than the land of the
                    Hernici. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Veturius in his first battle defeated
                    and routed his opponents; Lucretius, while <pb n="p.29"/> encamped among the
                    Hernici, was eluded by a <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"
                        >B.C. 462</note> company of raiders, who marched over the mountains of
                    Praeneste and thence down into the campagna; there they laid waste the
                    Praenestine and Gabinian fields; and from the latter district turned towards the
                    hills about Tusculum. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The City of Rome itself
                    received a great fright, more on account of the surprise than from any lack of
                    resources for defence. Quintus Fabius was in charge of the City. Arming the
                    young men and disposing his defences, he made everything secure and tranquil.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And so the enemy, having laid hold of the
                    plunder in their immediate neighbourhood, did not venture to approach Rome, but
                    making a detour, set out towards home. The farther they got from the hostile
                    City the less was their anxiety, till they came unexpectedly upon Lucretius the
                    consul, who having already marked their line of march, had drawn up his troops
                    and was eager to fight. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The spirits of the
                    Romans were therefore prepared for their task, while the enemy were stricken
                    with a sudden panic on being attacked, though by somewhat inferior numbers. The
                    Romans completely routed the great multitude, and driving them into deep
                    valleys, from which escape was difficult, surrounded them. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> There the Volscian name was almost blotted out. Thirteen
                    thousand four hundred and seventy fell in the battle and the flight, seventeen
                    hundred and fifty were taken alive, and twenty-seven military standards were
                    brought in, as I find recorded in certain annals; and though there may be some
                    exaggeration of the numbers, it was beyond question a great slaughter.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The victorious consul, in possession of
                    enormous spoils, returned to the permanent camp he had <pb n="p.31"/> occupied
                    before. Then the consuls encamped <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 462.</note> together, and the Volsci and Aequi united
                    their shattered forces. The ensuing battle was the third of that year. Fortune
                    bestowed the victory where she had done before; the enemy were routed, and even
                    lost their camp. </p>

                    the City. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Gaius Terentilius Harsa was tribune
                    of the plebs that year. Thinking that the absence of the consuls afforded the
                    tribunes an opportunity for action, he employed some days in complaining to the
                    people of the pride of the patricians, and inveighed especially against the
                    authority of the consuls, as a thing excessive and intolerable in a free state.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For it was only in name, he said, that it
                    was less hateful than that of a king; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> in
                    reality it was almost crueler, since in place of one master they had now got
                    two, who possessed an unregulated and unlimited power, and while free themselves
                    and without restraint, brought to bear all the terrors of the law and all its
                    punishments upon the plebs. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> That they might
                    not for ever have this licence, he was about to propose a law providing for the
                    appointment of five men to write out the statutes pertaining to the consular
                    power; <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Terentilius probably aimed at

                        perhaps misunderstood some such phrase in the annalist he was here

                    promulgated, the Fathers were alarmed lest they might be humbled, in the absence
                    of the consuls; the prefect of the City, Quintus Fabius, convened the senate,
                    and attacked the measure and its author himself with <pb n="p.33"/> such
                    bitterness that if both the consuls had been <note anchored="true"

                    an ambush and watching his opportunity had attacked the state. If the angry gods
                    had given them a tribune like him the year before, when they were suffering from

                    plague-stricken, and confusion everywhere, he would have proposed a law to do
                    away with consular government, and would have led the Volsci and the Aequi to
                    besiege the City. Pray what did he desire? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Was
                    he not at liberty, if the consuls had committed any act of pride or cruelty
                    against a citizen, to call them into court and accuse them where the judges
                    would be the very men against one of whom the injury had been done? <milestone

                    of the tribune that he was making hateful and intolerable; this power had been
                    reconciled and brought into harmony with the senate, but was now being degraded
                    again to its former evil state. Yet he would not supplicate Terentilius to

                    year the heavens were seen to blaze, and the earth was shaken with a prodigious
                    quake. That a cow had spoken —a thing which had found no credence the year
                    before —was now believed. Among other portents there was even a rain of flesh,

                    The two commissioners for sacred rites consulted the Sibylline Books, where it

                    they attack the highest places of the City, and blood be shed; amongst other
                    things was a warning to avoid factions. The tribunes charged them with trying to
                    hinder their law, and a violent struggle was impending; when lo! <milestone

                    to suppress the liberty of the Roman People, but cajoled and tricked them.

                    of the Volsci and Aequi made it incredible that they should be going to war on

                    There was no fear of foreign foes, no danger; the gods had seen to it the

                    the senators took courage, believing that the state was on its feet again. The
                    other consul, more spirited in co-operation than invention, had been quite
                    willing that his colleague should take the lead in initiating such weighty
                    measures; but in carrying them out he claimed for himself a share of the duties
                    of the consulship. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Then the tribunes, jeering
                    at what they termed the idle words of <pb n="p.71"/> Cincinnatus, proceeded to
                    inquire how the consuls were <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"

                    <quote>But we have no need of a levy,</quote> said Quinctius, <quote> for when
                        Publius Valerius gave arms to the people for the recovery of the Capitol,
                        they all made oath that they would assemble at the bidding of the consul and
                        not depart without his order. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> We therefore
                        command that all you who took the oath report to-morrow, armed, at Lake

                    from their obligation, resorted to a quibble: Quinctius had been a private
                    citizen at the time when they bound themselves by the oath. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> But there had not yet come about that contempt for the gods
                    which possesses the present generation; nor did everybody seek to construe oaths
                    and laws to suit himself, but rather shaped his own practices by them.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Accordingly the tribunes, as there was no
                    prospect of thwarting the design, concerned themselves with retarding the
                    departure; the more so since a story was about that the augurs had been
                    commanded to present themselves at Lake Regillus, there to inaugurate a place
                    where the auspices could be taken and matters brought before the people, to the
                    end that whatever had been enacted at Rome —thanks <milestone n="7"

                    the comitia; everybody, they said, would vote as the consuls wished; for there
                    was no appeal when one was more than a mile from the City, and the tribunes, if
                    they should come there, would be subjected, amongst the rank and file of the

                    upon their spirits was this, that Quinctius repeatedly <note anchored="true"

                    hold no consular election; the disease of the commonwealth was not one that
                    could be cured by ordinary remedies; the nation needed a dictator, that whoever

                    the tribunes with the troubled plebs. The multitude loudly besought protection,

                    brought up the demands of the tribunes and the plebs, and the senate resolved
                    that neither should the tribunes proceed with the law that year, nor the consuls
                    lead the army out of the City; that as regarded the future, it was the sense of
                    the senate that for magistrates to succeed themselves and for the same tribunes

                    the patricians also, that they might yield in no respect to the plebs, would

                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The consulship of Quintus Fabius and Lucius
                    Cornelius was a stormy one from the very beginning of the year. The tribunes
                    egged on the plebs; the Latins and the Hernici reported that a great attack was
                    being launched by the Volsci and the Aequi, and that Volscian levies were
                    already at Antium. There was much apprehension too lest the colony <pb n="p.77"
                    /> itself should revolt; and the tribunes were hardly <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 459</note> prevailed upon to allow
                    the war to have precedence. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Then the consuls divided the commands,
                    appointing Fabius to take the legions to Antium, and Cornelius to defend Rome,
                    lest some part of the enemy, in accordance with the Aequian custom, should make
                    a foray. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Hernici and the Latins were
                    bidden to furnish soldiers, as by treaty bound; two-thirds of the army were
                    allies, one-third citizens. When the allies had reported on the appointed day,
                    the consul encamped outside the Porta Capena. Thence, after purifying the army,
                    he set out for Antium, and took up a position at no great distance from the town
                    and the standing camp of the enemy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There the
                    Volsci, not daring to give battle —for the Aequian army had not yet come up
                    —sought to protect themselves, without fighting, behind their rampart. The next
                    day Fabius, instead of mingling allies and citizens in one line of battle, drew
                    up the three nations in three separate armies, about the enemy's works, taking
                    the centre himself with the Roman legions. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He
                    then commanded them all to wait for the signal, that the allies might act with
                    the citizens in beginning the fight, and in retreating, if he should sound the
                    recall. He also stationed the cavalry belonging to each division behind its
                    first line. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Advancing thus in three sections
                    he surrounded the camp, and attacking sharply on every side, dislodged the
                    Volsci, who were unable to sustain his charge, from their intrenchments. Passing
                    over these, he drove the frightened rabble before him in one direction and
                    cleared the camp of them. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As they dispersed in
                    flight, the cavalry, who had found it difficult to surmount the rampart and had
                    hitherto been mere <pb n="p.79"/> spectators of the battle, having now a clear

                    enemy as they attempted to escape, both in the camp and outside the works; but
                    the booty was still greater, since they had barely been able to carry away their
                    arms. If the forests had not covered the flight, their army would have been
                    utterly destroyed. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> While this battle was being fought near
                    Antium, the Aequi had sent forward the flower of their troops, and by a surprise
                    attack at night, had captured the Tusculan citadel. The rest of their army they
                    stationed at a short distance from the walls of the town, in order to induce the
                    enemy to extend his forces. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The news of these
                    events being speedily carried to Rome and thence to the camp at Antium, had the
                    same effect upon the Romans as if it had been announced that the Capitol was
                    taken, — so fresh in their recollection was the service done them by the
                    Tusculans, and so strongly did the similarity of the risk which their allies now
                    ran seem to call for repayment of the assistance they had given. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> Letting everything else go, Fabius quickly conveyed
                    the plunder of the camp to Antium, and leaving there a moderate garrison,
                    hastened by forced marches to Tusculum. The soldiers were allowed to take
                    nothing but their arms and such bread as happened to be at hand; <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified">The soldiers ordinarily carried a ration

                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The fighting at Tusculum lasted for some
                    months. With a part of his army the consul laid siege to the camp of the Aequi;
                    a part he had given to the Tusculans to use in recovering the citadel.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The place could <pb n="p.81"/> never be
                    entered by assault; but the enemy were <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 459</note> finally driven out by hunger. Having thus
                    reduced them to extremities, the Tusculans took away their arms, and stripping
                    them to the tunic, sent them under the yoke. As they were ignominiously fleeing
                    homeward, the Roman consul overtook them on Mount Algidus, and slew them, every
                    man. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The victor led his army back to Columen
                    —this is the name of a place <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Unidentified. Dion. Hal., x. xxi., calls the town Algidum. </note> —and went
                    into camp. The other consul too, now that the defeat of the enemy had removed
                    all danger from the walls of Rome, set out himself from the City. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> Thus at two points the consuls invaded the enemy's
                    borders, and with keen rivalry devastated the lands of the Volsci on the one
                    hand, and those of the Aequi on the other. I find in a good many writers that
                    the Antiates revolted that same year; and that Lucius Cornelius the consul
                    conducted the war and took the town. I should not venture to affirm it for a
                    certainty, since there is no mention of the matter in the older historians. </p>

                    patricians were alarmed by one waged against them at home, by the tribunes, who
                    cried out that the army was dishonestly kept afield —a trick intended to
                    frustrate the passage of the law; which, notwithstanding, they had undertaken
                    and proposed to carry through. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Still, Lucius
                    Lucretius, the prefect of the City, obtained the postponement of any action by

                    /> There had also arisen a new cause for disquiet. Aulus Cornelius and Quintus
                    Servilius, the quaestors, had summoned Marcus Volscius to trial, on the charge
                    that he had been guilty of undoubted perjury <pb n="p.83"/> against Caeso.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> For it was becoming generally known, <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 459</note> from many
                    witnesses, first, that the brother of Volscius after having once fallen ill had
                    not only never appeared in public, but had not even got up from his sick-bed,
                    where he had died of a wasting disease which lasted many months; <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> and secondly, that within the period to which
                    Volscius, in his testimony, had referred the crime, Caeso had not been seen in
                    Rome; for those who had served with him affirmed that he had often during that
                    time been in their company at the front, without taking any furlough. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> To prove this contention, many persons offered
                    Volscius to refer the question of fact to a private arbitrator. Since he did not
                    dare proceed to arbitration, all these things, pointing in one direction, made
                    the condemnation of Volscius as certain as that of Caeso had been made by
                    Volscius's evidence. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The tribunes delayed
                    matters by refusing to allow the quaestors to hold an assembly for his trial
                    until one should first have been held to consider the law. So both affairs

                    were seeking a fourth term of office —for the end of the year was now at hand
                    —and had diverted their efforts from the law to the contest for the election.
                    And though the consuls strove quite as vehemently against the re-election of the
                    incumbents to the tribuneship, as if a law were being urged which had been
                    promulgated to curtail their own majesty, the contest resulted in victory for

                    (The oak, a mighty tree, overhung head-quarters and with its dense shade

                    kept timidly within his breastworks. When the enemy perceived this, their
                    audacity was heightened, as is usually the case, by their opponents' fear, and
                    they attacked the camp by night. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Failing to
                    accomplish anything by open force, they next day surrounded the place with

                    the consul, not to make the victory a massacre, but to take their arms and let
                    them go. The consul referred them to the dictator, who in his anger added

                    The same tribunes of the plebs were returned; and in the following year, when
                    Titus Romilius and Gaius Veturius were consuls, they took occasion to urge the
                    law in all their speeches: They were ashamed, they said, of the futile increase
                    in their numbers, if this measure was to lie disregarded during their own two

                    thousand of the enemy were slain; the rest were put to flight; and immense
                    spoils were taken. These the consuls sold, owing to the impoverished condition
                    of the treasury. Nevertheless, their action made them unpopular with the army,
                    and it also furnished the tribunes with an occasion for impeaching the consuls
                    before the plebs. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Accordingly when they laid
                    down their office and Spurius Tarpeius and Aulus Aternius became consuls, they
                    were brought to trial; Romilius by Gaius Calvius Cicero, a plebeian tribune,
                    Veturius by Lucius Alienus, an aedile of the plebs. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Both were condemned, greatly to the indignation of the
                    patricians; Romilius was fined 10,000 asses, Veturius 15,000. And yet this
                    disaster to their predecessors did not diminish the energy of the new consuls;
                    they said that it was possible that they should themselves be condemned, but
                    that it was not possible that the plebs and the tribunes should carry their law.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Then the tribunes, discarding the law,
                    which, in the time it had been before the people, had lost its vitality, began
                    to treat more moderately with the patricians: Let them at last put an end, they
                    said, to these disputes; if the plebeian measure were not agreeable to them, let
                    them permit framers of laws to be appointed jointly from both the plebs and the
                    nobility, that they might propose measures which should be advantageous to both

                    surrendering his own prerogative that he might add to the liberty of the people

                    should have only such laws as their unanimity might fairly be considered not

                    When it appeared that the laws had been sufficiently amended, in the light of
                    the opinions that men expressed concerning each separate section, the centuriate
                    comitia met and adopted the Laws of the Ten Tables; which even now, in this
                    great welter of statutes piled one upon another, are the fountain-head of all
                    public and private law. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Afterwards the opinion
                    was general that there lacked two tables, by the addition of which a corpus, so
                    to speak, of all the Roman law could be rounded out. The hope of filling this
                    lack made people desirous, when election day drew near, of choosing decemvirs
                    again. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The plebs, besides the fact that they

                    recommended himself to the plebs; till even his colleagues, who had been
                    singularly devoted to him until then, looked askance at him and wondered what
                    this could mean. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was evident there could be
                    nothing genuine about it; so proud a man would certainly not be affable for
                    nothing; excessive self-abasement and mingling with private citizens were not so
                    much the marks of one who was in haste to retire from office as of one who
                    sought the means of re-election. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Open
                    opposition to his desires being more than they dared venture, they endeavoured
                    by a show of complaisance to lessen its intensity; and unanimously appointed

                    wearing, and began from that moment to live as his true nature prompted him. His
                    new colleagues too he commenced, even before they entered upon office, to
                    fashion after his own character. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Every day
                    they met together without witnesses. The tyrannical designs which they there
                    adopted they matured in secret. They now no longer sought to conceal their
                    pride; they were difficult of access, and surly towards those who sought to
                    speak with them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Thus they carried matters
                    until the Ides of <pb n="p.119"/> May, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"

                    term of office. So then, when they had taken up their duties, they signalized
                    the first day of their administration by a terrible threat. For whereas the
                    former decemvirs had kept to the rule that only one should have the fasces, and
                    that this regal emblem should pass from one to another in rotation, so that each
                    should have his turn, they suddenly appeared in public, every man with his
                    twelve fasces. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> A hundred and twenty lictors
                    crowded the Forum, and before them, bound up in the rods, they carried axes. And
                    indeed the decemvirs explained that there had been no reason for removing the
                    axe, since the office to which they had been chosen was without appeal.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They seemed like ten kings; and the terror
                    they inspired, not only in the humblest citizens but in the leaders of the
                    senate, was intensified by the belief that the decemvirs were merely seeking a
                    pretext and an opening for bloodshed, so that if anybody should pronounce a word
                    in praise of liberty, either in the senate or before the people, the rods and
                    axes might instantly be made ready, were it only to frighten the rest.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For besides that there was no help in the
                    people, the right of appeal having been taken away, they had further agreed not
                    to interfere with each other's decisions; whereas their predecessors had allowed
                    their judgments to be revised upon appeal to one of their colleagues; and
                    certain cases which might have been held to be within their own competence they
                    had referred to the people. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For a brief period
                    the terror was shared equally by all; but little by little its full force began
                    to fall upon the plebs. The patricians were left unmolested; humbler folk were
                    dealt with <pb n="p.121"/> arbitrarily and cruelly. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> It was all a question of persons, <note anchored="true"

                    decemvirs, since influence held with them the place of right. They concocted
                    their judgments in private, and pronounced them in the Forum. If anybody sought
                    redress from another decemvir, he came away regretting that he had not accepted
                    the decision of the first. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Moreover a report
                    had got out, though it was not vouched for, that they had not only conspired for
                    present wrongdoing but had ratified with an oath a secret agreement amongst
                    themselves not to call an election, but by means of a perpetual decemvirate to
                    hold the power they had once for all acquired. </p>

                    quarter where they had so feared enslavement as to have reduced the state to its
                    present plight. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The leading senators hated the
                    decemvirs and hated the plebs. They could not approve of the things that were
                    being done; still they believed them to be not undeserved. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> They had no desire to help those who in their greedy rush
                    for liberty had fallen upon servitude, preferring that their wrongs should even
                    be multiplied, that disgust at their actual situation might in the end arouse a
                    longing for the two consuls and the former status of affairs. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> And now the greater part of the year had passed, and the
                    two tables of laws had been added to the ten of the year before; nor was there
                    any further business to make the decemvirate necessary to the republic, so soon
                    as those statutes too should have been enacted in the centuriate assembly.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> People were anxiously looking forward to

                        type="margin">B.C. 419</note> concern: how were they ever going to restore

                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Meanwhile there was no mention of an
                    election. And the decemvirs, who had at first exhibited themselves to the plebs
                    in the society of former tribunes, because this had <milestone n="7??"
                        unit="section"/> been thought a recommendation to the people, had now
                    assumed a retinue of young patricians. Their bands blocked the tribunals. They
                    bullied the plebs and plundered their possessions; for success attended the
                    strong, no matter what they coveted. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And now
                    they ceased even to respect a man's person; some they scourged with rods, others
                    they made to feel the axe; and, that cruelty might not go unrequited, they
                    bestowed the victim's property upon his slayer. Corrupted by these wages, the
                    young nobles not only made no stand against wrong-doing, but frankly showed that
                    they preferred licence for themselves to liberty for all. </p>

                    magistrates to be elected, the decemvirs, now private citizens, appeared in
                    public with no abatement either of the spirit with which they exercised their

                        unit="section"/> But this was unmistakable tyranny. Men mourned for liberty
                    as for ever lost; nor did any one arise, or seem likely to do so, in its
                    defence. And not only had the people themselves lost heart; but they had begun
                    to be despised by the neighbouring nations, who could ill brook the existence of
                    imperial power where there was no liberty. <note anchored="true"

                    withdrew their army, which had ranged far and wide, to Eretum. There they
                    established a camp, hoping that the want of harmony at Rome would interfere with
                    the levying of troops. Not only the messengers who came, but the flight of the
                    country-people, who thronged the City, inspired a feeling of dismay. <milestone

                    sent an additional alarm. The Aequi came from another quarter and encamped on
                    Algidus, and from there raided the lands of Tusculum. Tusculan envoys brought
                    tidings of these acts, and besought protection. The fright which this occasioned
                    drove the decemvirs, now that the City was hemmed in between two simultaneous
                    wars, to consult the senate. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They ordered the
                    Fathers to be summoned to the Curia, though they were not ignorant how great a
                    storm of unpopularity was brewing: <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> the
                    devastation of the land and the dangers which impended would be laid by
                    everybody at their doors; and this would lead to an attempt being made to
                    abolish their magistracy, unless they presented a united resistance, and by
                    sharply exercising their power upon the few really daring spirits, put a stop to
                    the efforts of the rest. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When the crier's
                    voice was heard in the Forum, calling the senators to meet the decemvirs in the
                    Curia, it was like an innovation, so long had they disregarded the custom of
                    consulting the senate, and it aroused the attention of the plebs, who wondered
                    what in the world could have happened, that after so long an interval they <pb
                        n="p.127"/> should be reviving a forgotten usage; the enemy and <note

                    deserved men's gratitude, if anything whatever was being done which was usual in
                    a free state. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Men looked about in every corner
                    of the Forum to discover a senator, and seldom recognized one anywhere; then
                    their glances rested on the Curia and the decemvirs sitting there alone.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Meantime the decemvirs themselves
                    explained the Fathers' failure to assemble as owing to the universal detestation
                    of their rule; the commons as due to their having no authority, being private
                    citizens, to convoke the senate: a beginning, it seemed, was already being made
                    towards the recovery of freedom, if the plebs would join with the senate; and
                    if, even as the Fathers were refusing, when summoned, to attend the session, so
                    they, for their part, would reject the levy. Such were the murmurs of the plebs.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Of senators there was scarce one in the
                    Forum, and there were but few in the City. In their resentment at the situation
                    they had withdrawn to their farms and were absorbed in their private affairs,
                    disregarding those of the nation; for they felt that they were secure from
                    insult only so far as they removed themselves from contact and association with
                    their tyrannical masters. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> When on being cited
                    they failed to appear, officers were sent round to their houses, for the double
                    purpose of exacting fines and of ascertaining whether their recalcitrancy were
                    deliberate. They reported that the senators were in the country. This was more
                    pleasing to the decemvirs than if they had announced that the Fathers were in
                    town and repudiated their authority. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> They
                    commanded them all to be summoned, and proclaimed a meeting of the senate for
                    the following day. This session <pb n="p.129"/> was somewhat better attended
                    than they had <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        449</note> themselves expected. Whereupon the plebs concluded that liberty
                    had been betrayed by the senators, since those who had already gone out of
                    office and were mere private citizens, save for the force they exercised, were
                    obeyed by them as though they had the authority to command. </p>

                    senate-house was greater, we are told, than their submissiveness in the
                    expression of their views. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It is related that
                    Lucius Valerius Potitus, after Appius Claudius had proposed his motion and
                    before the senators were called upon in order for their opinions, demanded leave
                    to speak on the state of the nation; and when the decemvirs tried with threats
                    to prevent his doing so, stirred up a violent commotion by declaring that he
                    would go before the plebs. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> With equal spirit,
                    it is said, did Marcus Horatius Barbatus enter the dispute, calling them ten
                    Tarquinii, and warning them that the Valerii and the Horatii had been leaders in
                    the expulsion of the kings. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Livy did
                        not mention Horatius in his account of the expulsion of the kings, but he is

                    which men had hated in those days; and if these qualities had then been

                    they liked they might learn by making the experiment how much stronger
                    indignation was in the vindication of a man's own liberty than was ambition in
                    defence of unjust power. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The decemvirs talked
                    of a Sabine war, as if any war were more important to the Roman People than war
                    with those who, though they had been appointed to propose statutes, had left no
                    law in the state; who had done away with elections, with annual magistracies,
                    with the succession of new governors —the only means of equalizing liberty; —and
                    who, though private citizens, had the rods and the power of kings. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/> Following the expulsion of the kings there had been
                    patrician magistrates; later, after the secession of the plebs, plebeian
                    magistrates had been elected. Of what party, he asked, were they? Of the popular
                    party? Pray what had they done through the agency of the people? Of the

                    decemvirs were at a loss to know how far they could afford either to resent or
                    to overlook it; nor could they make out what the upshot was likely to be.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But Gaius Claudius, the uncle of Appius
                    the decemvir, made a speech, approaching more nearly to entreaty than
                    expostulation, in which <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> he implored him in
                    the name of his own brother's and his father's departed <pb n="p.133"/> spirits
                    to remember rather the civil society in which <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 449</note> he had been born than the

                        unit="section"/> This he begged much more for Appius's own sake than for the
                    sake of the nation; indeed the nation would demand its rights in spite of the
                    decemvirs, if they did not accord them voluntarily; but a great struggle usually
                    aroused great passions, and he shuddered to think what these might lead to.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Although the decemvirs wished to prevent
                    discussion of anything but the subject they had introduced, they were ashamed to
                    interrupt Claudius, who accordingly brought his speech to a conclusion, with the
                    proposal that the senate should take no action. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                    /> Everybody accepted this as meaning that Claudius held the decemvirs to be
                    private citizens; and many of consular rank signified their approval, without
                    discussion. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Another motion, ostensibly
                    harsher, but in reality somewhat less drastic, directed the patricians to
                    assemble and proclaim an interrex. For by passing any measure whatsoever they
                    declared those who presided over the senate to be magistrates; whereas they had
                    been rated as mere citizens by him who advised the senate against adopting any
                    resolution. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Thus the cause of the decemvirs
                    was already collapsing, when Lucius Cornelius Maluginensis, brother of Marcus
                    Cornelius the decemvir, who had purposely been reserved to be the last speaker
                    among the ex-consuls, defended his brother and his brother's colleagues by
                    feigning anxiety about the war. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He said he
                    wondered by what fatality it had come about that the decemvirs were being
                    attacked solely, or at least chiefly, by those who had sought election to that
                    office; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> or why it was that during <pb

                    nobody had raised the question whether regular magistrates were at the head of
                    affairs, and only now, when the enemy were almost at their gates, were men
                    sowing political dissension; unless it was because they thought that in troubled
                    waters it would be harder to discern what was going on. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> For the rest, was it not right that when men's attention
                    was taken up with the larger concern, all prejudgment of so important a matter
                    should be eliminated? He therefore proposed, concerning the charge brought by
                    Valerius and Horatius that the official term of the decemvirs had expired on the
                    day before the Ides of May, that they should first conclude the impending wars
                    and restore the state's tranquillity, and then refer the question to the senate
                    for settlement; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and that Appius Claudius
                    should at once make up his mind to recognize that he must explain, regarding the
                    comitia which he had held for the election of decemvirs —being one himself
                    —whether they were chosen for one year or until the missing laws should be
                    enacted. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Apparently the decemvirs
                        were technically within their rights in claiming that they held office until
                        the tables were ratified by popular vote. </note>
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> For the present he thought they should pay no
                    attention to anything but the war. If the current rumours about it seemed to
                    them to be false, and if they supposed that not only the couriers but the
                    Tusculan envoys also had brought them idle stories, he suggested that they send

                    should be held at the earliest possible moment; and the decemvirs should lead
                    the armies whither it seemed good to each of them, giving precedence to no other
                    business. </p>

                    in a second and more impassioned outburst, demanded that they be permitted to
                    speak about the state of the nation. They would address the people, they said,
                    if they were restrained by a faction from speaking in the senate; for neither

                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Thereupon Appius, thinking the moment was

                    he wished. But liberty went no further than speech; the decemvirs made good

                    should voluntarily abdicate than that hatred of them should lead to another

                    answered to their names, since the authority of the decemvirs was without
                    appeal. When the legions were enrolled, the decemvirs settled among themselves

                    fault of the generals was that they had made the citizens detest them; the rest
                    of the blame belonged to the soldiers, who, that nothing might anywhere prosper
                    under the command and auspices of the decemvirs, permitted themselves to be
                    beaten, to their own disgrace and that of their commanders. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Their armies were routed, both by the Sabines near Eretum,
                    and on Algidus by the Aequi. From Eretum they <pb n="p.141"/> fled in the

                    enemy followed them up, they nowhere ventured to fight in the open field, but
                    defended themselves by the position and their rampart, not by bravery and arms.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The disgrace on Algidus was worse, and a
                    worse disaster was sustained; even the camp was lost, and stripped of all their

                    of their hosts, —which nevertheless did not fail them. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> To Rome came such alarming reports that the patricians,
                    laying aside now their hatred of the decemvirs, voted to establish watches in
                    the City, and commanded all who were of an age to bear arms to guard the walls
                    and do outpost duty before the gates. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They
                    decreed that arms should be dispatched to Tusculum, and reinforcements, and that
                    the decemvirs should descend from the Tusculan citadel and hold their troops in
                    camp; that the other camp should be transferred from Fidenae to Sabine
                    territory, so that by taking the offensive they might frighten the enemy into
                    abandoning his design to besiege the City. </p>

                    soldiers, that they should elect tribunes and secede. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> So the generals sent him to look out a place for an

                    him, and several of the assassins fell, for he was very strong, and though

                        n="5" unit="section"/> The others reported at the camp that they had fallen
                    into an ambuscade, and that Siccius had perished, fighting valiantly, and with
                    him certain soldiers. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> At first their report
                    was believed; afterwards a cohort set out, by permission of the decemvirs, to
                    bury the slain; and finding that none of the bodies there had been despoiled,
                    and that Siccius lay armed in the midst, with all the bodies facing him, while
                    the enemy had left no dead nor any indication of having withdrawn, they brought
                    back the corpse, and declared that Siccius had certainly been murdered by his
                    own men. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The camp was ablaze with indignation,
                    and it was resolved that Siccius should be carried to Rome forthwith; but the
                    decemvirs made haste to give him a military funeral at the public cost. The
                    soldiers sorrowed greatly at his burial, and the worst reports were current
                    about the decemvirs. </p>

                    committed in Rome, which was inspired by lust and was no less shocking in its
                    consequences than that which had led, through the rape and the death of
                    Lucretia, to the expulsion of the Tarquinii from the City and from their throne;
                    thus not only did the same end befall the decemvirs as had befallen the kings,
                    but the same cause deprived them of their power. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                    /> Appius Claudius was seized with the desire to debauch a certain maiden
                    belonging to the plebs. The girl's father, Lucius Verginius, a <pb n="p.145"/>
                    centurion of rank, was serving on Algidus, a man <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 449</note> of exemplary life at home
                    and in the army. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> His wife had been brought up
                    in the same principles, and his children were being trained in them. He had
                    betrothed his daughter to the former tribune Lucius Icilius, an active man of
                    proven courage in the cause of the plebeians. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    She was a grown girl, remarkably beautiful, and Appius, crazed with love,
                    attempted to seduce her with money and promises. But finding that her modesty
                    was proof against everything, he resolved on a course of cruel and tyrannical
                    violence. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He commissioned Marcus Claudius, his
                    client, to claim the girl as his slave, and not to yield to those who demanded
                    her liberation, thinking that the absence of the maiden's father afforded an
                    opportunity for the wrong. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> As Verginia was
                    entering the Forum —for there, in booths, were the elementary schools —the
                    minister of the decemvir's lust laid his hand upon her, and calling her the
                    daughter of his bond-woman and herself a slave, commanded her to follow him, and
                    threatened to drag her off by force if she hung back. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Terror made the maiden speechless, but the cries of her
                    nurse imploring help of the Quirites quickly brought a crowd about them. The
                    names of Verginius her father and of her betrothed Icilius were known and
                    popular. Their acquaintance were led to support the girl out of regard for them;
                    the crowd was influenced by the shamelessness of the attempt. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> She was already safe from violence, when the claimant
                    protested that there was no occasion for the people to become excited; he was
                    proceeding lawfully, not by force. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He then
                    summoned the girl to court. She was advised by her supporters to 145 <pb
                        n="p.147"/> follow him, and they went before the tribunal of <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 449</note> Appius.
                    The plaintiff acted out a comedy familiar to the judge, since it was he and no
                    other who had invented the plot: The girl had been born, said Marcus, in his
                    house, and had thence been stealthily conveyed to the home of Verginius and
                    palmed off upon him as his own; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> he had good
                    evidence for what he said, and would prove it even though Verginius himself were
                    judge, who was more wronged than he was; meanwhile it was right that the
                    hand-maid should follow her master. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The
                    friends of the girl said that Verginius was absent on the service of the state;
                    he would be at hand in two days' time if he were given notice of the matter; it
                    was unjust that a man should be involved in litigation about his children when
                    away from home; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> they therefore requested
                    Appius to leave the case open until the father arrived, and in accordance with
                    the law he had himself proposed, grant the custody of the girl to the

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Appius prefaced his decision by saying that it
                    was evident how much he favoured liberty from that very law which the friends of
                    Verginius made the pretext for their claim; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    but the law would afford liberty a sure protection only if it varied neither
                    with causes nor with persons; for in the case of others who were claimed as
                    free, the demand was legal, since any one might bring an action: in the case of
                    one who was under the authority of a father there was no one else to whom the
                    master ought to yield the custody; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> accordingly
                    he decreed that the father should be summoned, and that meanwhile the <pb
                        n="p.149"/> claimant should not relinquish his right, but should <note

                        argued that Verginia was either the slave of his client or under her
                        father's control, and in neither case free, so that an action for recovering
                        her freedom did not lie, and it was merely a question of title between
                        Verginius and Marcus Claudius. </note>

                    men's concern over this, —he went to his house and wrote to his colleagues in
                    camp that they should grant no furlough to Verginius, and should even detain him
                    in custody. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> His base design was too late, as
                    it deserved to be; Verginius had already got his leave, and had set out in the
                    fore-part of the night, nor was it until early the next morning that the letters
                    for detaining him were delivered, to no purpose. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But in the City, as the citizens at break <pb

                    expectation, Verginius, dressed in sordid clothes and leading his daughter, who
                    was also meanly clad and was attended by a number of matrons, came down into the
                    market-place with a vast throng of supporters. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    He then began to go about and canvass people, and not merely to ask their aid as
                    a favour, but to claim it as his due, saying that he stood daily in the
                    battle-line in defence of their children and their wives; that there was no man
                    of whom more strenuous and courageous deeds in war could be related —to what
                    end, if despite the safety of the City those outrages which were dreaded as the
                    worst that could follow a city's capture must be suffered by their children?
                    Pleading thus, as if in a kind of public appeal, he went about amongst the
                    people. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Similar appeals were thrown out by
                    Icilius; but the women who attended them were more moving, as they wept in
                    silence, than any words. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In the face of all
                    these things Appius hardened his heart —so violent was the madness, as it may
                    more truly be called than love, that had overthrown his reason —and mounted the
                    tribunal. The plaintiff was actually uttering a few words of complaint, on the
                    score of having been balked of his rights the day before through partiality,
                    when, before he could finish his demand, or Verginius be given an opportunity to
                    answer, Appius interrupted him. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The discourse
                    with which he led up to his decree may perhaps be truthfully represented in some
                    one of the old accounts, but since I can nowhere discover one that is plausible,
                    in view of the enormity of the decision, it seems my duty to set forth the naked
                    fact, upon which all agree, that <pb n="p.157"/> he adjudged Verginia to him who
                    claimed her as his <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.

                    rooted to the spot in amazement at so outrageous a proceeding, and for a little
                    while after the silence was unbroken. Then, when Marcus Claudius was making his
                    way through the group of matrons to lay hold upon the girl, and had been greeted
                    by the women with wails and lamentations, Verginius shook his fist at Appius and
                    cried, <quote> It was to Icilius, Appius, not to you that I betrothed my
                        daughter; and it was for wedlock, not dishonour, that I brought her up.

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> and the decemvir, crazed with lust, declared

                    Roman People, but also from definite information, that all through the night
                    meetings had been held in the City to promote sedition. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Accordingly, having been aware of the approaching struggle,
                    he had come down into the Forum with armed men, not that he might do violence to

                    villainy. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then Verginius, seeing no help
                    anywhere, said, <quote> I ask you, Appius, first to pardon a father's grief if I

                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Permission being granted, he led his daughter

                        with this blood!</quote> The shout which broke forth at the dreadful deed
                    roused Appius, and he ordered Verginius to be seized. <milestone n="6"

                    wherever he came, and was also protected by a crowd of men who attached
                    themselves to him, and so reached the City gate. Icilius and Numitorius lifted
                    up the lifeless body and showed it to the people, bewailing the crime of Appius,

                        type="margin">B.C. 449</note> and especially Icilius, spoke only of the

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The wildest excitement prevailed amongst the

                        place="unspecified"> Livy doubtless means the crime of Appius rather than
                        the justifiable though shocking deed of Verginius (see chap. xlviii. § 7,
                        and chap. 1. § 5). </note> in part by the hope of improving the opportunity
                    to regain their liberty. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Appius first
                    commanded that Icilius be summoned; then, on his resisting, that he be arrested;
                    and at last, when the crowd would not allow his attendants to approach the man,
                    he headed a band of patrician youths in person, and advancing through the mob,
                    bade them drag his enemy off to prison. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> By
                    this time Icilius was supported not only by the populace but by the leaders of
                    the populace as well, Lucius Valerius and Marcus Horatius, who, forcing the
                    lictor back, declared that if Appius proceeded legally, they would protect
                    Icilius from the prosecution of a mere citizen; if he sought to make use of
                    violence, there too they would be a match for him. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> This led to a desperate struggle. The decemvir's lictor now
                    made a rush at Valerius and Horatius; his rods were broken by the mob. Appius
                    mounted the platform; Horatius and Valerius followed him. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> To them the crowd listened; the decemvir's voice they
                    drowned with noise. And now, as though vested with authority, Valerius was
                    commanding the lictors to withdraw from one who was a private citizen; when
                    Appius, broken in spirit and fearing for his life, covered up his head and
                    sought refuge in a house near the Forum, unobserved by his opponents. <milestone

                    burst into the Forum from the other <pb n="p.163"/> quarter. He saw that

                        type="margin">B.C. 449</note> by force. Distracted then by the suggestions
                    which came from every side, and timidly agreeing first with one and then with
                    another of his many advisers, he ended by ordering the senate to be summoned.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This course, inasmuch as a great
                    proportion of the patricians appeared to disapprove of the decemvirs' acts,
                    afforded hopes that the senators would end their power, and so quieted the
                    multitude. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The senate decided that the plebs
                    must not be provoked, and that it was even more necessary to see to it that the
                    arrival of Verginius in the army should not occasion any turbulence. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="50" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Accordingly certain of the younger senators
                    were dispatched to the camp, which was then on Mount Vecilius, and carried word
                    to the decemvirs that they must employ all their resources to keep the troops
                    from mutiny. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There Verginius aroused a greater
                    commotion than he had left in Rome. For besides that he was seen approaching
                    attended by a body of nearly four hundred men, who had joined him when he left
                    the City, in their anger and resentment at the affair, the weapon in his hand
                    and the gore with which he was spattered drew the attention of the entire camp
                    upon him. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Then too the appearance of togas in
                    the camp, in many places, produced the effect of a greater company of civilians
                    than were actually there. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Being asked what the
                    matter was, Verginius wept, and for a long time answered never a word; at
                    length, when the bustle and confusion of the gathering had subsided and silence
                    had ensued, he gave an orderly account of all that had taken place. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> Then, lifting up his hands in an attitude of prayer,
                    and addressing the <pb n="p.165"/> crowd as his fellow-soldiers, he besought

                    /> To him the life of his daughter had been dearer than his own, if she had been
                    permitted to live pure and chaste; when he saw her being carried off like a
                    slave to be dishonoured, thinking it better to lose his children by death than
                    by outrage, he had been impelled by pity to an act of seeming cruelty; nor would
                    he have survived his daughter, had he not hoped to avenge her death by the help
                    of his fellow-soldiers. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They too had
                    daughters, sisters, and wives; the lust of Appius Claudius had not been
                    extinguished with the life of Verginia, but its lawlessness would be
                    proportioned to its impunity. In the calamity of another they had been given a
                    warning to be on their guard against similar wrongs. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> So far as he was concerned, his wife had been taken from
                    him in the course of nature, his daughter, because she could no longer have
                    lived chaste, had died a pitiful but an honourable death; <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> for the lust of Appius there was now no longer in his house
                    any scope; from other forms which his violence might take he would defend his
                    own person with no less spirit than he had shown in defence of his daughter; the

                    multitude signified with responsive shouts that they would not forget his
                    sufferings nor fail to vindicate their liberty. And the civilians, mingling with
                    the crowd, repeated the same complaints and told them how much more shameful the
                    thing would have appeared if they could have seen it instead of <pb n="p.167"/>
                    hearing about it; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> at the same time they

                    that the decemvirate was already overthrown at Rome; and on the arrival of later
                    tidings, to the effect that Appius had almost lost his life and had gone into
                    exile, they induced the troops to raise the cry <quote>To arms!</quote>
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and to pluck up their standards and set out
                    for Rome. The decemvirs, troubled alike by what they saw and by what they heard
                    had taken place in Rome, rushed through the camp, one this way, another that, to
                    still the rising. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> And so long as they mildly
                    remonstrated, they got no answer; but if one of them tried to use his authority,
                    they told him that they were men, and armed. They marched in column to the City
                    and took possession of the Aventine, urging the plebeians, as often as they fell

                    their liberty and to elect plebeian tribunes. Save this, no violent proposals

                    Spurius Oppius. It was resolved that no harsh action should be taken, seeing

                    Their administration was favourable to the people, without in any way wronging
                    the patricians, though not without offending <pb n="p.183"/> them; <milestone

                    the plebs they regarded as a diminution of their own strength. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> To begin with, since it was virtually an undecided question
                    whether the patricians were legally bound by plebiscites, they carried a statute
                    in the centuriate comitia enacting that what the plebs should order in the
                    tribal organization should be binding on the people —a law which provided the
                    rogations of the tribunes with a very sharp weapon. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Next they not only restored a consular law about the
                    appeal, the unique defence of liberty, which had been overthrown by the
                    decemviral power, but they also safeguarded it for the future by the solemn
                    enactment of a new law, that no one should declare the <milestone n="5??"
                        unit="section"/> election of any magistrate without appeal, and that he who
                    should so declare might be put to death without offence to law or religion, and
                    that such a homicide should not be held a capital crime. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> And having sufficiently strengthened the plebs, by means of
                    the appeal on the one hand and the help of the tribunes on the other, they
                    revived, in the interest of the tribunes themselves, the principle of their
                    sacrosanctity (which was a thing that had now come to be well-nigh forgotten) by
                    restoring certain long-neglected ceremonies; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    and they rendered those magistrates inviolate, not merely on the score of
                    religion but also by a statute, solemnly enacting that he who should hurt the
                    tribunes of the plebs, the aediles, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    Expounders of the law deny that any one is sacrosanct by virtue of this statute,
                    but maintain that <pb n="p.185"/> the man who has injured any of these officials

                    may not be injured, —is nevertheless a proof that the aedile is not regarded as
                    sacrosanct; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> whereas the tribunes are
                    sacrosanct in consequence of the ancient oath taken by the plebs, when they

                    was now safe to proceed against individuals and that the time was ripe for doing
                    so, selected Verginius to bring the first accusation and Appius to be defendant.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When Verginius had cited Appius to appear,
                    and the latter, attended by a crowd of young patricians, had come down into the

                    being carried off to prison, deprived of his right to liberty, who had condemned
                    the person of a free citizen to slavery —the voice of Appius himself was heard
                    amidst the murmurs of the assembly, beseeching the Roman People to protect him.

                    affection for the Roman plebs, in consequence of which he had given up his
                    consulship —in order to make the laws equal for all —with great offence to the

                    plead his cause, he would try what would come of his own peculiar services and
                    shortcomings; at present he asked that, in accordance with the common right of
                    citizenship, he be permitted, being a Roman citizen and under accusation, to

                    He did not so fear men's malice as to have no hope in the justice and pity of

                    appealed once more to the tribunes of the plebs, and warned them not to <pb

                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> For who, he asked, should make an appeal,
                    if a man who had not been condemned, whose cause had not been heard, might not
                    do so? What humble plebeian would find protection in the laws, if they afforded
                    none to Appius Claudius? His own case would show whether the new statutes had
                    established tyranny or freedom, and whether the appeal to the tribunes and that
                    to the people against the injustice of magistrates had been merely a parade of
                    meaningless forms, or had been really granted. </p>

                    the tribunal, the stronghold of all crimes, where that man, as perpetual

                    threatening them all with rods and axes, despising gods and men, backed by
                    executioners instead of lictors, had began to turn his thoughts from rapine and
                    murder to lust; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and, in full sight of the
                    Roman People, had torn a free maiden from her father's arms, as though she had

                    client; —the <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> tribunal where, by his tyrannical
                    decree and wicked judgments, he had armed a father's right hand against his

                    —more moved by the disappointing of his pleasure than by her death. For Appius
                    too had been built that prison which he was wont to call the home of the Roman
                    plebs. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Accordingly, though he should again and
                    repeatedly appeal, he would himself again and repeatedly challenge him to prove
                    before a referee that he had not adjudged a free citizen to the custody of one
                    who claimed her as a slave. Should he refuse to go before a referee, he bade him
                    be led to gaol, as one found guilty. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Though
                    none raised his voice in disapproval, there were yet profound misgivings on the
                    part of the plebs when he was cast into prison, since they saw in the punishment
                    of so great a man a sign that their own liberty was already grown excessive. The
                    tribune appointed a day for the continuance of the trial. </p>

                    Optimus Maximus, to the Capitol. This was a golden crown, of no great weight,
                    for their states were not rich, and they observed the worship of the gods with

                    but he returned to Rome to beg for the pardon of the man whose vices he had
                    fled. In sordid garments, accompanied by his clansmen and clients, he went about
                    the Forum, soliciting the support of one citizen after another, beseeching them
                    that they would not seek to brand the Claudian race with the shame of being held
                    to merit imprisonment and chains. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> A man whose

                    his name; nor had there been any reconciliation between him and the man whose
                    adversity he sought to succour. By <pb n="p.197"/> courage they had got back

                    he pleaded. But Verginius begged them rather to pity himself and his daughter,
                    and to hearken, not to the entreaties of the Claudian family, whose province it
                    was to tyrannize over the plebs, but instead to those of Verginia's relations,
                    the three plebeian tribunes, who had been appointed to help the plebs but were

                    caused the arrest of Spurius Oppius, who stood next in point of unpopularity,
                    because he had been in the City when the unjust verdict was pronounced by his

                    was more responsible for men's bitterness towards him than the one which he
                    failed to prevent. A witness was produced who, after enumerating his
                    twenty-seven campaigns, during which he had eight times received special
                    decorations, which he wore in full sight of the people, tore open his tunic and
                    exhibited his back, scored by the rods, professing that if the defendant could
                    name any crime of which he had been guilty, he would suffer him without
                    complaining, private citizen though he was, to vent his rage upon him a second

                    the day of trial he there put an end to his life. The property of Claudius and
                    that of Oppius was <pb n="p.199"/> confiscated by the tribunes. Their colleagues

                    deliberately postponed engaging them; had he risked an immediate decision, it is
                    likely —such was the difference in spirit between the Romans and the enemy, in
                    consequence of the godless dealings of the decemvirs —that the struggle would
                    have cost him a severe defeat. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He established
                    his camp a mile from the enemy and kept his men within the works. The enemy
                    repeatedly drew up their troops in fighting order on the ground between the
                    camps, and challenged the Romans to come out and engage them; but no one
                    answered them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At length, weary with standing
                    and waiting, to no purpose, for the battle, the Aequi and Volsci concluded that
                    the Romans had virtually yielded them the victory; and marched off to pillage,
                    some against the Hernici, others against the Latins, leaving behind what was
                    rather a garrison for the camp than a sufficient force for giving battle.

                    spirits were by no means so high, and they sent out couriers far and wide, in
                    great alarm, to recall the marauders. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                    nearest of these hastened back; but those who were farther afield could not be
                    found. As soon as it was light, the Romans sallied from their camp, intending to
                    assault the rampart, unless the enemy gave battle. So, when the day was now far
                    spent and the enemy made no move, the consul ordered an advance. The Roman line
                    having got in motion, the Aequi and Volsci were ashamed that their victorious
                    armies should depend for protection upon stockades, instead of valour and the
                    sword. Accordingly they too demanded of their leaders, and received, the signal

                    should be strongly posted in full force, advanced to the charge. <milestone

                    of the Aventine and the Sacred Mount, that they might bring back an undiminished
                    power to the spot where liberty had a few months before been won, and might show
                    that the nature of Rome's soldiers was the same after the expulsion of the
                    decemvirs that it had been before they were elected, and that equality before

                    made a detour over unoccupied ground, and finding the enemy everywhere in flight
                    turned most of them back from their camp and frightened them off by riding

                    themselves, for they had long been eager to fight. It was a battle such as takes
                    place when both armies are confident; for the glory of the one was ancient and
                    unbroken, and the other was exalted by its recent unaccustomed victory.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Moreover the Sabines employed a stratagem
                    to increase their strength; for when they had marshalled a front of equal extent
                    with the Roman, they held two thousand men in reserve to hurl against their
                    opponent's left, as soon as the battle should be under way. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> These troops, attacking in flank, had almost encompassed
                    that wing, and were beginning to overpower it; when the cavalry of the two
                    legions, numbering about six hundred, leaped down from their horses and rushed
                    to the front, where their comrades were already giving ground. There they made a
                    stand against the foe and at the same time roused the courage of the infantry,
                    first by sharing the danger on equal terms, and then by causing them to feel
                    ashamed. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They felt humiliated that the cavalry
                    should be fighting in their own fashion and in that of infantry too, and that
                    the infantry should not be as good as the horsemen, even when these were
                    dismounted. </p>

                    <milestone n="63" unit="chapter"/>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> They therefore renewed the battle which on
                    their flank had been given up, and advanced again into the position from which
                    they had retreated, and in a trice the fighting was not merely even, but the
                    Sabine wing had begun to yield. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The horsemen,
                    under cover of the ranks of infantry, regained their mounts. Then they galloped
                    across to the other wing, announcing the victory to their friends; and at the
                    same time they made a charge against the <pb n="p.213"/> enemy, who were already
                    panic-stricken, as they <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"
                        >B.C.449</note> might well be when the stronger of their wings had been
                    defeated. No other troops showed more conspicuous courage in that battle.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The consul looked out for every
                    contingency, commended the brave, and upbraided any who fought listlessly. Being
                    rebuked they would at once begin to acquit themselves like men, —shame proving
                    as powerful an incentive to them as praise to the others. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> With a fresh cheer all along the line the Romans made a
                    concerted effort and drove the enemy back, and from that moment there was no
                    resisting the violence of their onset. The Sabines fled in confusion through the
                    fields and left their camp to be plundered by their foes. There the Romans won
                    back not the possessions of their allies, as on Algidus, but their own which had
                    earlier been lost to them through the raids on their lands. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Though a double victory had been gained in two
                    separate battles, the senate was so mean as to decree thanksgivings in the name
                    of the consuls for one day only. The people went unbidden on the second day also
                    in great numbers, to offer up thanks to the gods; and this unorganized and
                    popular supplication was attended with an enthusiasm which almost exceeded that
                    of the other. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The consuls had arranged to
                    approach the City within a day of one another, and summoned the senate out into
                    the Campus Martius. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> While they were there
                    holding forth on the subject of their victories, complaints were made by leading
                    senators that the senate was being held in the midst of the army on purpose to
                    inspire fear. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> And so the consuls, to allow no
                    room for the accusation, adjourned the senate from that place to the Flaminian
                    Meadows, where the temple of Apollo <pb n="p.215"/> is now, and which was called
                    even then Apollo's <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        449</note> Precinct. When the Fathers, meeting there, refused with great
                    unanimity to grant a triumph, Lucius Icilius the plebeian tribune laid the issue
                    before the people. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Many came forward to
                    dissuade them, and Gaius Claudius was particularly vehement. It was a triumph,
                    he said, over the patricians, not Rome's enemies, which the consuls desired;
                    they were seeking a favour in return for personal services they had done the
                    tribune, not an honour in requital of valour. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Never before had a triumph been voted by the people; the decision whether this
                    honour had been deserved had always rested with the senate; not even the kings
                    had infringed the majesty of the highest order in the state; let not the
                    tribunes so dominate all things as not to suffer the existence of any public
                    council; if each order retained its own rights and its own dignity, then, and
                    only then, would the state be free and the laws equal for all. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> After many speeches had been made to the same purpose by
                    the other older members of the senate, all the tribes voted in favour of the
                    motion. Then, for the first time, a triumph which lacked the authorization of
                    the senate was celebrated at the bidding of the people. <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified"> It was not the last time, however ( <hi rend="italics"
                            >cf.</hi> vii. xvii. 9). Sometimes the consul triumphed without the
                        authorization of either senate or plebs (x. xxxvii. 8), in which case the
                        ceremony took place on the Alban Mount; sometimes by virtue of a plebiscite
                        confirmed by resolution of the senate (iv. xx. 1). But unless granted by the
                        senate the triumph was paid for by the victorious consul, instead of by the
                        state. </note>

                    had nearly resulted in a dangerous abuse; for the tribunes conspired together to
                    obtain their re-election, and, that their own ambition might be less
                    conspicuous, to procure as well the return to office of the consuls. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> Their pretext was the solidarity of the patricians,
                    which had operated, by injurious treatment of the consuls, to break down the
                    authority of the tribunes of the plebs. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> What

                    established, the new tribunes should be assailed through the agency of consuls
                    belonging to the patricians' own party? For there would not always be consuls
                    like Valerius and Horatius, who preferred the liberty of the plebs to their own
                    interests. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> By a fortunate chance in this
                    emergency the superintendence of the elections fell by lot to none other than
                    Marcus Duillius, a far-seeing man who perceived that the re-election of the
                    magistrates would be fraught with odium. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But
                    when he asserted that he would not consider the candidacy of any of the former
                    tribunes, his colleagues vehemently insisted that he should receive the
                    suffrages of the tribes without restriction, or else resign the presidency of
                    the election to his fellow-tribunes, who would conduct the voting in accordance
                    with the law rather than the desires of the patricians. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> A controversy having thus arisen, Duillius summoned the
                    consuls before the benches of the tribunes and asked them what course they meant
                    to pursue in the consular elections; and finding, by their replying that they
                    should have new consuls chosen, that he had got in them popular supporters of
                    his unpopular policy, he went with them before the assembly. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> When the consuls, on being there brought forth to the
                    people and asked what they would do if the Roman People, mindful of their help
                    in the recovery of liberty at <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> home and
                    remembering their military successes, should again elect them to office,
                    declined to alter their determination, Duillius first praised the consuls for
                    persisting to the end in their unlikeness to the decemvirs, and then held the
                    election. And after five tribunes had been chosen <pb n="p.219"/> and no other

                    He declared that the law had been satisfied, which, without anywhere prescribing
                    the number, provided only that the tribunate should not be left vacant; and
                    directed that those who had been elected should co-opt colleagues. <milestone

                    let them get safely off; they must destroy them, horse and man, that none might
                    ride back into the battle or renew the fight. It would be impossible, he said,
                    for their cavalry to resist his men, when the close ranks of their infantry had
                    given way before them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> His words did not fall
                    upon deaf ears. With a single rush the Romans routed the entire body of cavalry.
                    Hurling great numbers of them from their horses, they transfixed men and steeds
                    with their javelins. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This ended the
                    cavalry-battle. Then they fell upon the hostile infantry, and sent off gallopers
                    to announce their success to the consuls, where the enemy's line was already
                    beginning to give way. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Livy is
                        thinking chiefly of Quinctius. From § 10 it appears that Agrippa's victory
                        came later. </note> The tidings at once aroused fresh ardour in the

                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 446</note> in the centre that their
                    defeat began, where the attack of the troopers had thrown their ranks into
                    disorder; then the left wing began to fall back before the consul Quinctius.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Romans experienced most difficulty on
                    the right; there Agrippa, young, active, and courageous, perceiving that the
                    battle was everywhere going better than on his own front, snatched the standards
                    from the men who bore them, and began to carry them forward himself, and even to
                    fling some of them into the press of the enemy. The disgrace with which his
                    soldiers were thus threatened spurred them to the attack, and the victory was
                    extended to every part of the line. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> A message
                    then came from Quinctius, saying that he had beaten the enemy and was already
                    threatening their camp, but did not wish to storm it until he knew that the
                    fight had been decided on the left wing also; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    if Agrippa had already defeated his opponents, let him bring up his troops, that
                    the entire army might enter together into possession of the spoils. The
                    victorious Agrippa accordingly joined his victorious colleague, with mutual
                    congratulations, in front of the enemy's camp. <milestone n="13" unit="section"
                    /> Its handful of defenders was speedily put to flight, and the Romans burst
                    into the entrenchments without encountering resistance. The consuls led their
                    army back to the City laden with a vast quantity of booty, as well as with the
                    goods which they had lost by the pillage of their fields but had now recovered.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> I do not find either that the consuls
                    themselves asked for a triumph or that one was offered them by the senate; nor
                    is there any record of the reason why <pb n="p.243"/> they despised the honour
                    or did not hope for it. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"

                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The best conjecture I myself can offer, after
                    so long an interval of time, is this: since the consuls Valerius and Horatius,
                    who besides beating the Volsci and Aequi had also attained renown by bringing
                    the Sabine war to a successful conclusion, had been refused a triumph by the
                    senate, they were ashamed to ask for that distinction in recompense of an
                    achievement only half as great, lest even if it should be granted, it might seem
                    that account had been taken rather of persons than of deserts. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The glory of defeating the enemy was sullied
                    by a shameful judgment given by the people in Rome regarding the boundaries of
                    her allies. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The men of Aricia and those of
                    Ardea had often gone to war over a territory which both cities claimed.
                    Exhausted by the many defeats which each had experienced, they referred their
                    quarrel to the Roman People for decision. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When
                    they had come to plead their cause, and a popular assembly had been granted them
                    by the magistrates, they argued their respective claims with great vehemence.
                    The testimony had already been taken, and the time had come for the tribes to be
                    summoned and the people to give their votes, when Publius Scaptius, an aged
                    plebeian, arose and said: <quote> If I am permitted, consuls, to speak
                        concerning the nation's interests, I will not suffer the people to go wrong
                        in this matter. </quote>
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The consuls declared that he was an
                    untrustworthy fellow and ought not to be listened to, and when he protested
                    noisily that the public cause was being betrayed, they ordered him to be
                    removed; whereat he appealed to the tribunes. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The tribunes, as almost always <pb n="p.245"/> happens, were swayed by the
                    crowd, instead of <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C.
                        446</note> swaying it, and, to please the greedy ears of the plebs, gave
                    Scaptius leave to say what he wished. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He
                    therefore began, and said that he was eighty-two years old and had fought in the
                    army, in that district which was under discussion, not as a youth, but as one
                    already in his twentieth year of service at the time of the campaign before
                    Corioli. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Hence it came that he was telling
                    them of a matter forgotten with the lapse of years, but fixed in his own memory,
                    namely that the disputed land had been a part of the territory of Corioli, and
                    had consequently, on the capture of that town, become, by right of conquest, the
                    property of the Roman People. He marvelled, he said, at the effrontery with
                    which the men of Ardea and Aricia hoped to deprive the Roman People —whom they
                    had made the judge, in place of being the owner —of a territory over which they
                    had never exercised any authority so long as the state of Corioli was intact.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He had himself but a little while to live;
                    yet he had not been able to convince himself that, having as a soldier done his
                    part to conquer the land, he should not defend it, even in his old age, with the
                    only weapon left him, to wit his voice. He earnestly counselled the people not
                    to condemn their own cause from an unreasonable motive of propriety. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When the consuls had perceived that Scaptius
                    was listened to not only in silence but actually with approval, they called on
                    gods and men to witness that a great outrage was being perpetrated, and sent for
                    the leaders of the senate. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> With them they went
                    about among the tribes and implored <pb n="p.247"/> them not to be guilty of an
                    act which, utterly wrong <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin"
                        >B.C. 446</note> in itself, would establish a precedent that was even worse,
                    by diverting to their own possession, as judges, the property in dispute; and
                    that too when, even if it were right that a judge should be concerned for his
                    own advantage, they would by no means gain so much by the seizure of the land as
                    they would lose by the wrongful estrangement of their allies. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> For reputation at least and trustworthiness were things the
                    loss of which was beyond all reckoning. Was this to be the report carried home
                    by the envoys? Was this to be noised abroad and come to the ears of allies and
                    enemies? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> What grief it would cause the former,
                    and what joy the latter! Did they suppose that Scaptius, a meddling old
                    hanger-on of assemblies, would be held responsible for this by the neighbouring
                    nations? It would be a famous thing for Scaptius to have inscribed beneath his
                    portrait, but the Roman People would be playing a role of chicanery and of
                    usurpation of the claims of others. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> For what
                    umpire in a private suit would have thought of awarding to himself the object of
                    litigation? Even Scaptius, though he had already outlived all sense of shame,
                    would not do that. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> These arguments were loudly
                    urged both by the consuls and by the Fathers; but they were less convincing than
                    men's cupidity, or than Scaptius, who had aroused it. The tribes, being called
                    upon to vote, decided the territory to be public land belonging to the Roman
                    People. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Nor is it denied that such would have
                    been the verdict if recourse had been had to another court; but in the
                    circumstances the excellence of the cause did not in the slightest degree
                    extenuate the disgrace of the judgment, <pb n="p.249"/> which seemed no less
                    scandalous and harsh to the <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"
                        type="margin">B.C. 446</note> Roman senators than to the men of Aricia and
                    Ardea. The remainder of the year passed without disturbances in either domestic
                    or foreign relations. </p>
