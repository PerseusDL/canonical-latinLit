                        slaves. Quintius Cincinnatus called from the cultivation of his farm in the
                        country, made dictator, and appointed to conduct the war against the
                        Aequans. He conquers the enemy, and makes them pass under the yoke. The
                        number of the tribunes increased to ten. Decemvirs, appointed for the

                        a code of laws contained in ten tables, obtain a continuation of their
                        authority for another year, during which they add two more to the former ten
                        tables. Refusing to resign their office, they retain it a third year. Their
                        conduct at first equitable and just; afterwards arbitrary and tyrannical.
                        The commons, in consequence of the base attempt of Appius Claudius, one of
                        them, to debauch the daughter of Virginius, seize on the Aventine mount, and
                        oblige them to resign. Appius and Oppius, two of the most obnoxious, are
                        thrown into prison, where they put an end to their own lives; the rest are
                        driven into exile. War with the Sabines, Volscians, and Aequans.â€”Unfair
                        decision of the Roman people, who being chosen arbitrators between the

                        themselves. </p>

                    Quintus Fabius are elected consuls. This was the Fabius Quintus who alone had
                    survived the family cut off at Cremera. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Already, in his former consulate, Aemilius had been an adviser of giving land to
                    the people. Accordingly in his second consulate also both the abettors of the
                    agrarian law had raised themselves to the hope of carrying the measure, and the
                    tribunes, supposing that a matter frequently attempted in opposition to both
                    consuls might be obtained with the assistance at least of one consul, take it
                    up, and the consul remained stedfast in his sentiments. <milestone n="3"

                    complaining that a person at the head of the state was recommending himself by
                    his tribunitial proceedings, and that he was making himself popular by giving
                    away other persons' property, had transferred the odium of the entire <pb
                        n="159" xml:id="p.159"/> affair from the tribunes to the consul. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> A violent contest was at hand, had not Fabius set the
                    matter straight, by an expedient disagreeable to neither party, <quote> that
                        under the conduct and auspices of Titus Quintius, there was a considerable
                        tract of land taken the preceding year from the Volscians; <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> that a colony might be sent to Antium, a neighbouring,
                        convenient, and maritime city; that the commons might come in for lands
                        without any complaints of the present occupiers, that the state might remain
                        in quiet. </quote>
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This proposition was accepted. He appoints as
                    triumvirs for distributing the land, Titus Quintius, Aulus Virginius, and
                    Publius Furius: those who wished to obtain land were ordered to give in their
                    names. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The gratification of their aim begat
                    disgust, as usually happens; so few gave in their names that Volscian colonists
                    were added to fill up the number: the rest of the people preferred clamouring
                    for land in Rome, rather than receive it elsewhere. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The Aequans sued for peace from Quintus Fabius, (he was
                    sent thither with an army,) and they themselves broke it by a sudden incursion
                    into the Latin territory. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In the following year Quintus Servilius, (for
                    he was consul with Spurius Posthumius,) being sent against the Aequans, fixed
                    his camp in the Latin territory: inaction necessarily kept the army within the
                    camp, involved as they were in a distemper. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    The war was protracted to the third year, Quintus Fabius and Titus Quintius
                    being consuls. To Fabius, because he, as conqueror, had granted <note

                    province was assigned by an extraordinary commission: who, setting out with
                    certain hope that the fame of his name would reduce the Aequans to submission,
                    sent ambassadors to the council of the nation, and ordered them to say <quote>
                        that Quintus Fabius, the consul, stated that he had brought peace to Rome
                        from the Aequans, that from Rome he now brought war to the Aequans, that
                        same right hand being armed, which he had formerly given to them in amity;
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> that the gods were now witnesses, and
                        would presently be avengers of those by whose perfidy and perjury that was
                        brought to pass. That he, however, be matters as they <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> might, would even now prefer that the Aequans should
                        repent of their own accord than be <pb n="160" xml:id="p.160"/> subject to
                        the vengeance of an enemy. If they repent, that there would be a safe
                        retreat in <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> that clemency already
                        experienced; but if they still delighted in perjury, they would wage war
                        with the angry gods rather than with enemies. </quote> This statement had so
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> little effect on any of them, that the
                    ambassadors were near being ill-treated, and an army was sent to Algidum against
                    the Romans. When these tidings were brought to Rome, the indignity of the
                    affair, rather than the danger, called out the other <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> consul from the city; thus two consular armies advanced
                    against the enemy in order of battle, so that they might at once engage. But as
                    it so happened that much of the day did not now remain, a person from the
                    advanced guard of the enemy cries out, <quote> This is making a display of war,
                        Romans, not waging it; you draw up your army in <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> line of battle, when night is at hand; we require a
                        greater length of day-light for <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> the
                        contest which is to come on. To-morrow by sun-rise return to the field: you
                        shall have an opportunity of fighting, never fear. </quote> The soldiers,
                    stung by these threats, are marched back into the camp till the following day;
                    thinking that the approaching night was tedious, which would cause delay to the
                    contest. Then indeed they refresh their bodies with food and sleep: <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/> on the following day, when it was light, the Roman
                    army took their post considerably sooner. At length the Aequans also came
                    forward. The battle was obstinate on both sides, because both the Romans fought
                    under the influence of resentment and hatred; and a consciousness of danger
                    brought <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> on by misconduct, and despair of
                    obtaining future confidence afterwards, obliged the Aequans to exert and have
                    recourse to the most desperate efforts. The Aequans however did not withstand
                    the Roman troops, and when on being beaten they had betaken themselves to their
                    own territories, the outrageous multitude, with dispositions not at all more
                    disposed to peace, began to chide their leaders: <quote> that their interest was
                        committed to the hazard of a pitched battle, in which mode of fighting the
                        Romans were superior. That the Aequans were better fitted for <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> depredations and incursions, and that several
                        parties acting in different directions conducted wars more successfully than
                        the unwieldy mass of one single army. </quote>

                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Having left therefore a guard on the camp,
                    they marched out and attacked the Roman frontiers with such fury, as to <pb
                        n="161" xml:id="p.161"/> carry terror even to the city: <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> the unexpected nature of the thing also caused more alarm,
                    because nothing could be less apprehended, than that an enemy, vanquished and
                    almost besieged in their camp, should entertain a thought of depredation:
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and the peasants, in a panic pouring in at
                    the gates, cried out, that it was not mere plundering, nor small parties of
                    depredators, but, exaggerating every thing through groundless fear, that whole
                    armies and legions of the enemy were advancing, and that they were pushing
                    forward to the city determined for an assault. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Those who were nearest (the gates) carried to others the accounts heard from
                    these, uncertain as they were, and therefore the more groundless; and the hurry
                    and confused clamour of those calling to arms bore no distant resemblance to the
                    panic of a city taken by storm. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It so happened
                    that the consul Quintius had returned to Rome from Algidum; this was some relief
                    for their terror; and the tumult being calmed, and after chiding them for being
                    in dread of a vanquished enemy, he posted a guard on the gates. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Then having convened the senate, when he set out to defend
                    the frontiers, a suspension <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italics">Justitium</hi> â€”a jure sistendo. </note> of civil
                    business having been proclaimed by a decree of the senate, leaving Quintus
                    Servilius behind as prefect of the city, he found no enemy in the <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> country. Matters were conducted with distinguished
                    success by the other consul; who having attacked the enemy, wherever he knew
                    that they were to come, laden with booty, and proceeding therefore with their
                    army the more encumbered, made their depredation prove fatal to <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> them. Few of the enemy escaped from the ambuscade; all the
                    booty was recovered; thus the return of the consul Quintius to the city put a
                    termination to the justitium, which lasted only four <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> days. A census was then held, and the lustrum was closed by
                    Quintius: the number of citizens rated are said to have been one hundred and
                    twenty-four thousand two hundred and fourteen, besides orphans of both
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> sexes. Nothing memorable occurred
                    afterwards among the Aequans; they betook themselves into their towns, suffering
                    their possessions to be consumed by fire and to be devastated. The consul, after
                    he had repeatedly carried depredation through the entire country of the enemy,
                    returned to Rome with great glory and booty. <pb n="162" xml:id="p.162"/>

                    Fusus were consuls. Furii some writers have written Fusii; this I mention, lest
                    any one may imagine that the change, which is only in the names, may be in the
                    persons themselves. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There was no doubt but
                    that one of the consuls would commence hostilities against the Aequans. The
                    Aequans accordingly sought aid from the Volscians of Ecetra; which being granted
                    readily, (so keenly did these states vie in inveterate hatred against the
                    Romans,) preparations for war were made with the utmost vigour. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> The Hernicians came to the knowledge of it, and warned the
                    Romans that the Ecetrans had revolted to the Aequans; the colony of Antium also
                    was suspected, because when the town was taken, a great number of the
                    inhabitants had fled thence for refuge to the Aequans: and these proved the
                    bravest soldiers during the war with the Aequans. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Afterwards the Aequans being driven into the towns, this
                    rabble withdrawing privately, when they returned to Antium, seduced from the
                    Romans the colonists who were already disposed to treachery of their own accord.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The matter not being yet ripe, when it was
                    announced to the senate that a defection was intended, the consuls were charged
                    to inquire into the business by summoning to Rome the leading men of the colony.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When those persons attended without
                    reluctance, being conducted to the senate by the consuls, they so answered to
                    the questions put to them, that they were dismissed more suspected than they had
                    come. Upon this war was considered as inevitable. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Spurius Fusius, one of the consuls to whom that province
                    had fallen, having marched against the Aequans, found the enemy committing
                    depredations in the country of the Hernicians; and being ignorant of their
                    numbers, because they had never been seen all together, he rashly hazarded an
                    engagement with an army not a match for their forces. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Being beaten from his ground at the first onset, he betook
                    himself to his camp: nor was that an end of the danger: for both on the next
                    night and the following day, his camp was beset and assaulted with such vigour,
                    that not even a messenger could be sent from thence to Rome. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> The Hernicians brought an account both that a defeat had
                    taken place, and that the army was besieged: and they struck such terror into
                    the senate, that a charge was given to the other consul Posthumius, that he

                    attempts were made on either side, because the enemy, having the advantage in
                    numbers, attempted to weaken the Roman strength by dividing it into many parts,
                    as not being likely to suffice for all points of attack. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> At the same time the camp was besieged, at the same time a
                    part of the army was sent to devastate the Roman territory, and to attempt the
                    city itself, if fortune should favour. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Lucius
                    Valerius was left to guard the city: the consul Postumius was sent to repel the
                    attacks on the frontiers. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There was no
                    abatement in any part either in vigilance or activity; watches in the city,
                    out-posts before the gates, and guards stationed along the walls: and a
                    justitium was observed for several days (a thing which was necessary in such
                    general confusion). In the mean time the consul Furius, after he had at first
                    passively endured the siege in his camp, burst forth from the Decuman gate on
                    the enemy when off their guard; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> and though he
                    might have pursued them, he stopped through fear, lest an attack should be made
                    on the camp from the other side. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                    lieutenant-general Furius (he was the consul's brother) was carried away too far
                    by his ardour; nor did he, from his eagerness to pursue, observe his own party
                    returning, nor the attack of the enemy on his rear: thus being shut out, after
                    repeatedly making many unavailing efforts to force his way to the camp, he fell,
                    fighting bravely. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And the consul, turning
                    about to renew the fight, on hearing the account that his brother was
                    surrounded, rushing into the thick of the fight rather rashly than with
                    sufficient caution, received a wound, and was with difficulty rescued by those
                    around him. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This both damped the courage of
                    his own men, <pb n="164" xml:id="p.164"/> and rendered the enemy more daring;
                    who, being encouraged by the death of the lieutenant-general, and by the
                    consul's wound, could not afterwards be withstood by any force, so as to prevent
                    the Romans from being driven within their camp and again submitting to a siege,
                    as being a match for them neither in hopes nor in strength; and every thing
                    would have been endangered, had not T. Quintius come to their relief with
                    foreign troops from the Latin and Hernician army. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> He at- tacked the Aequans on their rear whilst intent on
                    the Roman camp, and insultingly displaying the head of the lieutenant- general,
                    and, a sally being made at the same time from the camp on a signal given at a
                    distance by him, he surrounded a great number of the enemy. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Of the Aequans on the Roman territory the slaughter was
                    less, their dispersion was more complete. On these as they straggled in
                    different directions, and were driving plunder before them, Postumius made an
                    attack in several places, where he had posted convenient de- tachments; these
                    straying about and pursuing their flight in great disorder, fell in with the
                    victorious Quintius as he was returning with the wounded consul. <milestone
                        n="11" unit="section"/> Then did the consular army by their distinguished
                    bravery take ample vengeance for the consul's wound, and for the death of the
                    lieutenant-general and the cohorts; heavy losses were both inflicted and
                    received on both sides during those days. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> In
                    a matter of such anti- quity it is difficult to state with certainty the exact
                    number of those who fought or fell: Antias Valerius, however, ven- tures to sum
                    them up; <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> that in the Hernician territory
                    there fell five thousand three hundred Romans; that of the preda- tory parties
                    of the Aequans, who strayed through the Roman frontiers for the purpose of
                    plundering, two thousand four hundred were slain by the consul Postumius; that
                    the rest of the body that were driving booty before them, and which fell in with
                    Quintius, by no means got off with so light a loss: that of these four thousand,
                    and by way of stating the num- ber exactly, two hundred and thirty, were slain.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> After this they returned to Rome; the

                    other pro- digies either actually presented themselves to their sight, or
                    exhibited imaginary appearances to their affrighted minds. To avert these
                    terrors, a solemn festival of three days was pro- claimed, during which, all the
                    temples were filled with a <pb n="165" xml:id="p.165"/> crowd of men and women,
                    earnestly imploring the protection of the gods. <milestone n="15" unit="section"

                    homes, thanks having been returned to them for their spirited military services.
                    The thousand soldiers from Antium were dismissed almost with disgrace, because

                    shaken off disease, gradually began to be more healthy, and their attention

                    Publius Valerius Publicola, on the third day after he had entered on his office
                    of interrex, causes Lucretius Tricipitinus, and Titus Veturius Geminus, (or
                    Velusius,) to be elected consuls. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They enter
                    on their consulship on the third day of the Ides of August, the state being now

                    Hernicians brought an account that the enemy had made an incursion into their

                    Veturius was sent against the Volscians to carry on an offensive war. <milestone

                    plunderers which had marched over the Praenestine mountains, and from thence
                    descended into the plains, escaped the notice of Lucretius, whilst he lay
                    encamped amongst the Hernicians. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> These laid
                    waste all the country around Praeneste and Gabii: from the Gabinian territory
                    they turn their course towards the heights of Tusculum; great alarm was excited
                    in the city of Rome also, more from the suddenness of the affair, than that

                    and tranquil. The enemy therefore carrying off plunder from the adjacent places,
                    not venturing to approach the city, when they were returning by a circuitous
                    route, their caution being now more relaxed, in proportion as they removed to a
                    greater distance from the enemy's city, fall in with the consul Lucretius, who
                    had already explored their motions, drawn up in battle-array and determined on
                    an engagement. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Accordingly having attacked
                    them with predetermined resolution whilst struck with sudden panic, though
                    considerably fewer in numbers, they rout and put to flight their numerous army,
                    and having driven them into the deep valleys, when an egress from thence was not
                    easy, they surround them. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> There the Volscian
                    nation was almost entirely cut off. In some histories I find that thirteen
                    thousand four hundred and seventy fell in the field and in the pursuit, that one
                    thousand two hundred and fifty were taken alive, that twenty-seven military
                    standards were carried off; where, though there may have been some exaggeration
                    in the number, there certainly was great slaughter. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> The victorious consul having obtained immense booty
                    returned to the same standing camp. Then the consuls join their camps. The
                    Volscians and Aequans also unite their shattered strength. This was the third
                    battle on that year; the same good fortune gave them victory; the enemy being
                    beaten, their camp was also taken. </p>

                    the absence of the consuls, after railing against the arrogance of the
                    patricians for several days before the people, inveighed chiefly against the
                    consular <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> authority, as being exorbitant and
                    intolerable in a free state: "for that, in name <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    /> only, it was less invidious, in reality almost more oppressive than that of
                    kings. For that two masters had been <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> adopted
                    instead of one, with unbounded, unlimited power; who, themselves unrestrained
                    and unbridled, directed all the terrors of the law, and all kinds of severity
                    against the commons. Now, in order that this licentious power might not continue
                    perpetual, he would propose a law, that five persons be appointed to draw up
                    laws regarding the consular <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> power. That the
                    consul should use that right which the people may give him over them; that they
                    should not hold their own caprice and licentiousness as law. This law being
                    published, when the patricians became afraid, lest, in the absence of the

                    Fabius, praefect of the city, who inveighed so vehemently against the bill and

                        watching his opportunity, he made an attack on the commonwealth. If the gods
                        in their anger had given them any tribune like him on the preceding year,
                        during the pestilence and war, he could not have been withstood. Both the

                        consuls adopted any tyrannical or cruel proceedings against any of the

                    Aequans, though their strength was much impaired, were recruiting their armies:
                    that their chief dependence was Antium; that the inhabitants of Antium openly
                    held councils at Ecetra: that that was the source â€”there the strength â€”for the

                    as it was one likely not to be directed by prudence, but abandoned to temerity
                    and daring. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The consuls also generally kept
                    out of the way, lest in the general confusion they should expose their dignity
                    to any insult. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There was a young man, Caeso
                    Quintius, a daring youth, as well by the nobility of his descent, as by his
                    personal size and strength; to those endowments granted by the gods he himself
                    had added many military honours, and eloquence in the forum; so that no person

                    centre of a body of the patricians, conspicuous above the rest, carrying as it
                    were in his eloquence and bodily strength dictatorships and consulships
                    combined, he alone withstood the storms of the tribunes and the populace.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Under his guidance the tribunes were
                    frequently driven from the forum, the commons routed and dispersed; such as came
                    in his way, went off after being ill-treated and stripped; so that it became
                    sufficiently evident, that, if he were allowed to proceed in this way, the law
                    would be defeated. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then the other tribunes
                    being now almost thrown into despair, Aulus Virginius, one of the college,
                    institutes a criminal prosecution on a capital charge against Caeso. By this

                    army, because silence was (observed) with regard to the law, many thought that
                    the tribunes were struck with dismay. But they, (for it was now the close of the

                    of lessening their own dignity, the victory in the contest was on the side of

                    glory this year both at home and in war, because they both re-established peace
                    abroad and at home; though the state was not in a state of absolute concord, yet

                    The consuls obstructed the law, the tribunes the trial of Volscius in the same
                    manner: but in the new quaestors there was greater power, and greater influence.

                    false witness who had deprived an innocent person of the power of pleading his

                    was allowed to the consuls to examine into the law: so that, when they had
                    satisfied the people, as to what secret designs were concealed under it, they
                    should then allow them to give their votes. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The granting this respite established tranquillity in the city. The Aequi
                    however did not allow them long rest; who, in violation of the treaty which had
                    been made with the Romans the year before, confer the chief command on Gracchus
                    Claelius. He was then the leading man amongst the Aequi. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Under the command of Gracchus they carry hostile

                    laden with booty they pitch their camp at Algidum. To that camp Quintus Fabius,
                    Publius Volumnius, Aulus Posthumius, come to complain of the wrongs committed,

                    country of the Aequi. The tribunes, according to their practice, attempted to
                    obstruct the levy; and probably would have eventually prevented it, but a new

                    arms; two large armies were raised, the tribunes remonstrating to no purpose.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Nautius led the one against the Sabines;
                    and having pitched his camp at Eretum, by small detachments, generally by
                    nightly incursions, he effected such desolation in the Sabine land, that, when
                    compared to it, the Roman territories seemed intact by an enemy. <milestone

                        unit="section"/> When the enemy perceived this, their boldness increased, as
                    sometimes happens, from others' fears; and having attacked his camp by night,
                    when open force did not succeed well, they on the following day drew lines of
                    circumvallation around it. Before these could close up all the passes, by a

                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Accordingly the panic and the alarm was as

                    profusion. Lucius Quintius, the sole hope of the Roman people, cultivated a farm
                    of four acres, at the other side of the Tiber, which are called the Quintian

                    they had been foiled for five years, and as that was but little protection to

                    twenty lictors filled the forum, and carried before them the axes tied up with
                    the fasces: and they explained that it was of no consequence that the axe should

                        because an appeal from the consuls to the people was allowed. Whence, since

                    people some points which might seem to come within their own jurisdiction. For a
                    considerable time the terror seemed equalized among all ranks; gradually it
                    began to turn entirely on the commons. They spared the patricians; arbitrary and
                    cruel treatment was shown to the humbler classes: they were wholly respective of
                    the person, not of the cause: as being persons with whom interest usurped the

                    the year was now passed, and two tables of laws had been added to the ten tables
                    of the former year; and if these laws also were once passed in an assembly of

                    made of the elections, and the decemvirs, who had at first exhibited themselves
                    to the people, surrounded by men of tribunitian rank, because that was deemed

                    followed the punishment of the owner. Corrupted by such bribes, the young

                    for ever; nor does any champion stand forth, or appear likely to do so. And not
                    only they themselves sunk into despondence, but they began to be looked down
                    upon by the neighbouring states; and they felt indignant that dominion should
                    exist where liberty was lost. The Sabines with a numerous body of men made an
                    incursion on the Roman territory; and having committed extensive devastations,
                    after they had driven with impunity booty of men and cattle, they recalled their

                    there, grounding their hopes on the dissensions at Rome; (and trusting) that
                    they would prove an obstruction to the levy. Not only the couriers, but the
                    flight of the country people through the city, occasioned alarm. The decemvirs
                    consult what <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> should be done. Whilst they were
                    thus left destitute between the hatred of the patricians and people, fortune
                    added, moreover, another cause of alarm. The Aequans on the opposite side pitch
                    their camp at Algidum; and ambassadors from Tusculum, imploring relief, bring

                    detachments from thence. The panic occasioned hereby urged the decemvirs to
                    consult the senate, two wars at the same time surrounding the city. They order
                    the patricians to be summoned into the senate-house, well aware what a storm of

                    being enrolled, the decemvirs set about arranging among themselves who should
                    set out to the war, who command the armies. The leading men among the decemvirs
                    were, Quintus Fabius and Appius Claudius. There appeared a more serious war at
                    home than abroad. They considered the violence of Appius as better suited to
                    suppress commotions in the city; that Fabius possessed a disposition rather
                    inconstant in good pursuits than strenuous in bad ones. <milestone n="9"

                    his office of decemvir and his colleagues had so changed, that he chose rather
                    to be like to Appius than like himself. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> To
                    him the war against the <pb n="210" xml:id="p.210"/> Sabines was committed, his
                    colleagues, Manius Rabuleius and Quintus Paetelius, being sent with him. Marcus
                    Cornelius was sent to Algidum with Lucius Menucius and Titus Antonius, and Caeso
                    Duilius and Marcus Sergius: they determine on Spurius Oppius as an assistant to
                    Appius Claudius to protect the city, their authority being equal to that of all

                    fault in the generals was, that they had rendered themselves objects of hatred

                    soldiers; who, lest any enterprise should succeed under the conduct and auspices
                    of the decemvirs, suffered themselves to be beaten, to their own disgrace, and
                    that of them (the generals). Their armies were routed by the Sabines at Eretum,
                    and in Algidum by the Aequans. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Having fled
                    from Eretum during the silence of the night, they fortified their camp nearer to
                    the city, on an elevated situation between Fidenae and Crustumeria; <milestone

                    disgrace and greater loss were sustained in Algidum, their camp also was lost;

                    reason of their age to carry arms, should mount guard on the walls, and form
                    out-posts before the gates; they also voted arms to be sent to Tusculum, besides

                    and that the enemy might be deterred, by thus attacking them first, from

                    whom they had sent to accompany him in that expedition, to attack him in a

                    kill him with impunity; for several of the assassins fell around him resisting
                    them, whilst, possessing great personal strength and with a courage equal to
                    that strength, he was defending himself against them, now surrounded as he was.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The rest bring an account into the camp
                    that Siccius, when fighting bravely, had fallen into an ambush, and that some

                    bodies there were stripped, that Siccius lay in the middle with his arms, all
                    the bodies being turned towards him, whilst there was neither any body of the

                    decemvirs hastened to perform a military funeral for him at the public expense.
                    He was buried amid the great grief of the soldiery, and with the worst possible

                    which drove the Tarquins from the city and the throne through the injured
                    chastity and violent death of Lucretia: so that the decemvirs not only had the
                    same end as the kings had, but the same cause also of losing their power. Appius
                    Claudius was seized with a criminal passion for violating the person of a young
                    woman of plebeian condition. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Lucius Virginius,

                        unit="section"/> His wife had been educated in a similar manner, as also
                    were their children. He had betrothed his daughter to Lucius Icilius, who had
                    been a tribune, a man of spirit and of approved zeal in the interest of the

                    with desire, at- tempted to seduce by bribes and promises; and when he perceived
                    that all the avenues (to the possession of her) were barred by modesty, he
                    turned his thoughts to cruel and tyrannical violence. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> He instructed a dependent of his, Marcus Claudius, to claim
                    the girl as his slave, and not to yield to those who might demand her interim
                    retention of liberty; considering that, because the girl's father was absent,
                    there was an opportunity for committing the injury. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> The tool of the decemvir's lust laid hands on the girl as

                    he commanded her to follow him; that he would force her away if she demurred.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The girl being stupified with terror, a
                    crowd collects at the cries of the girl's nurse, who besought the protection of
                    the citizens. The popular names of her father, Virginius, and of her spouse,
                    Icilius, are in the mouths of every one. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Their
                    regard for them gains over their acquaintances, whilst the heinousness of the

                    by her advising her to follow him, they now reached the tribunal of Appius. The

                    him, that it was unfair that in his absence he should run any risk regarding his

                        it, if, whilst the city was still secure, their children would be exposed to
                        suffer the severest hardships which would have to be dreaded if it was

                    laws proposed by the consuls. It was also regulated by the same consuls, that

                    soon as the Sabines saw the Roman army being draw up in order of battle, they
                    too, as being long since eager for the encounter, come forward. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> The battle was such a one as may be expected between two
                    armies confident in themselves, the one animated by the glory of former and

                    stratagem also; for having formed a line equal (to that of the enemy,) they kept
                    two thousand men in reserve, to make an attack on the left wing of the Romans in
                    the heat of the battle. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When these, by an

                    arousing in them a sense of shame. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> It was a
                    matter of shame that the cavalry should fight in their own proper character and
                    in that of others; and that the infantry should not be equal to the cavalry even

                    covered between the ranks of the foot, return to their horses; they then gallop
                    across to the other division to announce their success to their party; at the
                    same time also they make a charge on the enemy, now disheartened by the
                    discomfiture of their stronger wing. The valour of none shone more conspicuous
                    in that battle. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The consul provided for all
                    emergencies; he applauded the brave, rebuked wherever the battle seemed to
                    slacken. When reproved, they displayed immediately the energy of brave men; and
                    a sense of shame stimulated them as much as praises excited the others.

                    united effort, they drive the enemy back; nor could the Roman power be any
                    longer resisted. The Sabines, driven in every direction through the country,
                    leave behind them their camp as plunder for the enemy. There the Roman recovers
                    the effects not of the allies, as at Algidum, but his own property, which had

                    For this double victory, obtained in two battles, in two different places, the
                    senate through jealousy decreed merely supplications in the name of the consuls
                    for one day only. The people went, however, on the second day also in great
                    numbers of their own accord to offer thanksgiving; and this unauthorized and

                    great a distance of time, when a triumph had been refused to the consuls
                    Horatius and Valerius, who, in addition to the Aequans and Volscians, had gained
                    the glory of finishing the Sabine war, the consuls were ashamed to demand a
                    triumph for one half of the services done by them; lest if they even should
                    obtain it, regard of persons rather than of merit might appear to have been
                    entertained. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> A disgraceful decision of the people regarding
                    the boundaries of their allies disgraced the honourable victory obtained over
                    their enemies. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The states of Aricia and of
                    Ardea, having frequently contended in arms concerning a disputed piece of land,
                    and being wearied out by many mutual losses, appointed the Roman people as
                    arbitrators. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> When they came to support their
                    claims, an assembly of the people being granted them by the magistrates, a
                    debate ensued conducted with great warmth. And the witnesses being now produced,
                    when the tribes were to be called, and the people were to give their votes,
                    Publius Scaptius, a plebeian advanced in years, rises up and says; <quote>
                        Consuls, if it is permitted me to speak on the public interest, I will not
                        suffer the people to be led into a mistake in this matter. </quote>
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When the consuls said that he, as unworthy of
                    attention, was not to <pb n="247" xml:id="p.247"/> be heard, and, on his
                    exclaiming <quote>that the public interest was being betrayed,</quote> ordered
                    him to be put aside, he appeals to the tribunes. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                    /> The tribunes, as they are always directed by the multitude, rather than they
                    direct them, indulged the people, who were anxious to hear him, in granting
                    Scaptius leave to say what he pleased. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He then
                    commences: <quote> that he was in his eighty-third year, and that he had served
                        in that district which was now in dispute, not even then a young man, as he
                        was serving his twentieth campaign, when operations were going on at
                        Corioli. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He therefore adduced a fact
                        forgotten by length of time, but one deeply fixed in his own memory: the
                        district now in dispute had belonged to the territory of Corioli, and after
                        the taking of Corioli, it became by right of war the public property of the
                        Roman people. That he was surprised how the states of Ardea and Aricia
                        should hope to intercept from the Roman people, whom from being the right
                        owners they made arbitrators, a district the right to which they never
                        claimed whilst the state of Corioli subsisted. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> That he for his part had but a short time to live; he
                        could not however bring himself, old as he now was, to decline claiming by
                        his voice, the only means he now had, a district which, as a soldier, he had
                        contributed to acquire, as far as an individual could. That he strenuously
                        advised the people not to damn their own interest by an improper feeling of
                        delicacy. </quote>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The consuls, when they perceived that Scaptius
                    was listened to not only in silence, but even with approbation, appealing to
                    gods and men, that an enormous and disgraceful act was being committed, send for
                    the principal senators: <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> with these they went
                    around to the tribunes; entreated, that, as judges, they would not be guilty of
                    a most heinous crime, with a still worse precedent, by converting the dispute to
                    their own interest, more especially when, even though it may be lawful for a
                    judge to protect his own emolument, so much would by no means be acquired by
                    keeping the land, as would be lost by alienating the affections of their allies
                    by injustice; for that the losses of character and of reputation were greater
                    than could be estimated. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Were the ambassadors
                    to carry home this answer; was this to go out to the world; were their allies to
                    hear this; were their enemies to hear it â€”with what sorrow the one â€”with what
                    joy the other party? <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Could <pb n="248"
                        xml:id="p.248"/> they suppose, that the neighbouring states would impute
                    this proceeding to Scaptius, an old babbler at assemblies? that Scaptius would
                    be rendered distinguished by this statue: that the Roman people would assume the
                    character of a usurper and intercepter of the claims of others. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> For what judge in a private cause ever acted in this way,
                    so as to adjudge to himself the property in dispute? That even Scaptius himself
                    would not act so, though he has now outlived all sense of shame." <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> Thus the consuls, thus the senators exclaimed; but
                    covetousness, and Scaptius, the adviser of that covetousness, had more
                    influence. The tribes, when convened, decided that the district was the public
                    property of the Roman people. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Nor is it denied
                    that it might have been so, if they had gone to other judges; now the disgrace
                    of the decision is certainly not at all diminished by the fairness of the title:
                    nor did it appear more disgraceful or more hideous to the people of Aricia and
                    of Ardea, than it did to the Roman senate. The remainder of the year continued
                    free from either city or foreign commotions. </p>
