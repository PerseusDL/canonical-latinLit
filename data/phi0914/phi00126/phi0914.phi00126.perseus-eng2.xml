                    <p> Hannibal encamps on the banks of the Anio, within three miles of Rome.
                        Attended by two thousand horsemen, he advances close to the Colline gate to
                        take a view of the walls and situation of the city. On two suc- cessive days
                        the hostile armies are hindered from engaging by the severity of the
                        weather. Capua taken by Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius; the chief
                        nobles die, voluntarily, by poison. Quintus Fulvius having con- demned the
                        principal senators to death, at the moment they are actually tied to the
                        stakes, receives despatches from Rome, commanding him to spare their lives,
                        which he postpones reading until the sentence is executed. Publius Scipio,
                        offering himself for the service, is sent to command in Spain; takes New
                        Carthage in one clay. Successes in Sicily. Treaty of friendship with the
                        Aetolians. War with Philip, king of Macedonia, and the Acarnanians. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> THE consuls, Cneius Fulvius Centumalus and
                    Publius Sulpicius Galba, having entered on their office on the ides of March,
                    assembled the senate in the Capitol, and took the opinion of the fathers on the
                    state of the republic, the manner of conducting the war, and on what related to
                    the provinces and the armies. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Quintus Fulvius
                    and Appius Claudius, the consuls of the former year, were continued in command;
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and the armies which they before had were
                    assigned to them, it being added that they should not withdraw from Capua, which
                    they were besieging, till they had taken it. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    The Romans were now solicitously intent upon this object, not from resentment so
                    much, which was never juster against any city, as from the consideration that as
                    this city, so celebrated and powerful, had by its defection drawn away several
                    states, so when reduced it would bring back their minds to respect for <pb
                        n="1018" xml:id="p.1018"/> the former supreme government. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Two praetors also of the former year, Marcus Junius and
                    Publius Sempronius, were each continued in command of the two legions which they
                    had under them, the former in Etruria, the latter in Gaul. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Marcus Marcellus also was continued in command, that he
                    might, as proconsul, finish the war in Sicily with the army he had there.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> If he wanted recruits he was to take them
                    from the legions which Publius Cornelius, the propraetor, commanded in Sicily,
                    provided he did not choose any soldier who <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/>
                    was of the number of those whom the senate had refused to allow to be
                    discharged, or to return home till the war was put an end to. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> To Caius Sulpicius, to whose lot Sicily had fallen, the two
                    legions which Publius Cornelius had commanded were assigned, to be recruited
                    from the army of Cneius Fulvius, which had been shamefully beaten, and had
                    experienced a dreadful loss the year before in Apulia. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> To soldiers of this description the senate had assigned the
                    same period of service as to those who fought at Cannae; and as an additional
                    mark of ignominy upon both, they were not allowed to winter in towns, or to
                    build huts for wintering within the distance of ten miles from any town.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> To Lucius Cornelius, in Sardinia, the two
                    legions which Quintus Mucius had commanded were assigned; if recruits were
                    wanted, the consuls were ordered to enlist them. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> To Titus Otacilius and Marcus Valerius was allotted the
                    protection of the coasts of Sicily and Greece, with the legions and fleets which
                    they had commanded. The Greek coast had fifty ships with one legion; the
                    Sicilian, a hundred ships with two legions. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Twenty-three legions were employed by the Romans in carrying on the war this
                    year by land and sea. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In the beginning of the year, on a letter from
                    Lucius Marcius being laid before the senate, they considered his achievements as
                    most glorious; but the title of honour which he assumed (for though he was
                    neither invested with the command by the order of the people, nor by the
                    direction of the fathers, his letter ran in this form, <quote>The proprietor to
                        the senate</quote> ) gave offence to a great many. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> It was considered as an injurious precedent for generals to
                    be chosen by the armies, and for the solemn ceremony of elections, held under
                    auspices, to be transferred to camps and provinces, and (far from the control of
                    the laws and magistrates) to military thoughtlessness. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> And though some gave it as their opinion, that the <pb
                        n="1019" xml:id="p.1019"/> sense of the senate should be taken on the
                    matter, yet it was thought more advisable that the discussion should be
                    postponed till after the departure of the horsemen who brought the letter from
                    Marcius. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> It was resolved, that an answer
                    should be returned respecting the corn and clothing of the army, stating, that
                    the senate would direct its attention to both those matters; but that the letter
                    should not be addressed to Lucius Marcius, proprietor, lest he should consider
                    that as already determined which was the very point they reserved for
                    discussion. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> After the horsemen were dismissed,
                    it was the first thing the consuls brought before the senate; <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> and the opinions of all to a man coincided, that the
                    plebeian tribunes should be instructed to consult the commons with all possible
                    speed, as to whom they might resolve to send into Spain to take the command of
                    that army which had been under the conduct of Cneius Scipio. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The plebeian tribunes were instructed accordingly, and the
                    question was published. But another contest had pre-engaged the minds of the
                    people: Caius Sempronius Blaesus, having brought Cneius Fulvius to trial for the
                    loss of the army in Apulia, harassed him with invectives in the public
                    assemblies: <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    <quote>Many generals,</quote> he reiterated, <quote> had by indiscretion and
                        ignorance brought their armies into most perilous situations, but none, save
                        Cneius Fulvius, had corrupted his legions by every species of excess before
                        he betrayed them to the enemy; it might therefore with truth be said, that
                        they were lost before they saw the enemy, and that they were defeated, not
                        by Hannibal, but by their own general. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> No
                        man, when he gave his vote, took sufficient pains in ascertaining who it was
                        to whom he was intrusting an army. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> What a
                        difference was there between this man and Tiberius Sempronius! The latter,
                        having been intrusted with an army of slaves, had in a short time brought it
                        to pass, by discipline and authority, that not one of them in the field of
                        battle remembered his condition and birth, but they became a protection to
                        our allies and a terror to our enemies. They had snatched, as it were, from
                        the very jaws of Hannibal, and restored to the Roman people, Cumae,
                        Beneventum, and other towns. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> But Cneius
                        Fulvius had infected with the vices peculiar to slaves, an army of Roman
                        citizens, of honourable parentage and liberal education; and had thus made
                        them insolent and turbulent among their allies, inefficient and dastardly
                        among their ene- <pb n="1020" xml:id="p.1020"/> mies, unable to sustain, not
                        only the charge, but the shout of the Carthaginians. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> But, by Hercules, it was no wonder that the troops did
                        not stand their ground in the battle, when their general was the first to
                        fly; with him, the greater wonder was, that any had fallen at their posts,
                        and that they were not all the companions of Cneius Fulvius in his
                        consternation and his flight. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Caius
                        Flaminius, Lucius Paullus, Lucius Posthumius, Cneius and Publius Scipio, had
                        preferred falling in the battle to abandoning their armies when in the power
                        of the enemy. But Cneius Fulvius was almost the only man who returned to
                        Rome to report the annihilation of his army. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> It was a shameful crime that the army of Cannae should
                        be transported into Sicily, because they fled from the field of battle, and
                        not be allowed to return till the enemy has quitted Italy; that the same
                        decree should have been lately passed with respect to the legions of Cneius
                        Fulvius; <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> while Cneius Fulvius himself has
                        no punishment inflicted upon him for running away, in a battle brought about
                        by his own indiscretion; that he himself should be permitted to pass his old
                        age in stews and brothels, where he passed his youth, while his troops,
                        whose only crime was that they resembled their general, should be sent away
                        in a manner into banishment, and suffer an ignominious service. <milestone

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The accused shifted the blame from himself to
                    his soldiers; he said, <quote> that in consequence of their having in the most
                        turbulent manner demanded battle, they were led into the field, not on the
                        day they desired, for it was then evening, but on the following; that they
                        were drawn up at a suitable time and on favourable ground; but either the
                        reputation or the strength of the enemy was such, that they were unable to
                        stand their ground. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When they all fled
                        precipitately, he himself also was carried away with the crowd, as had
                        happened to Varro at the battle of Cannae, and to many other generals.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> How could he, by his sole resistance,
                        benefit the republic, unless his death would remedy the public disasters?
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> that he was not defeated in
                        consequence of a failure in his provisions; that he had not, from want of
                        caution, been drawn into a disadvantageous position; that he had not been

                        force, and by arms, in a regular engagement. He had not in his power the

                    that if Rome were in danger, either both the Roman generals, or at least one of

                    afford a favourable opportunity either to himself or the Campanians of gaining
                    some advantage. One consideration only disquieted him, and that was, lest on his

                    The plebeian aediles brought a supply of provisions there. The consuls and the

                    held on the state of the republic. It was resolved that the consuls should
                    encamp in the neighbourhood of the Colline and Esquiline gates; that Caius
                    Calpurnius, the city praetor, should have the command of the Capitol and the
                    citadel; and that a full senate should be continually assembled in the forum, in
                    case it should be necessary to consult them amidst such sudden emergencies.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Meanwhile, Hannibal advanced his camp to
                    the Anio, three miles from the city, and fixing his position there, he advanced
                    with two thousand horse from the Colline gate as far as the temple of Hercules,
                    and riding up, took as near a view as he could of the walls and site of the

                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> After the fight had begun, the consuls
                    ordered the Numidian deserters who were on the Aventine, to the number of twelve
                    hundred, to march through the midst of the city to the Esquiliae, judging that
                    no troops were better calculated to fight among the hollows, the garden walls,
                    and tombs, or in the enclosed roads which were on all sides. <milestone n="6"

                    as they filed off on horseback down the Publician hill, cried out that the

                    occasioned such confusion and terror, that if the Carthaginian camp had not been
                    without the city, the whole multitude, such was their alarm, would have rushed
                    out. They then fled for refuge into their houses and upon the roofs, where they
                    threw stones and weapons on their own soldiers as they passed along the streets,
                    taking them for enemies. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Nor could the tumult
                    be repressed, or the mistake explained, as the streets were thronged with crowds
                    of rustics and cattle, which the sudden alarm had driven into the city.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The battle between the cavalry was
                    successful, and the enemy were driven away; and as it was necessary to repress
                    the tumults which were arising in several quarters without any cause, it was
                    resolved that all who had been dictators, consuls, or censors, should be
                    invested with authority till such time as the enemy had retired from the walls.

                    Rome was to be the prize of the victors, a violent shower of rain mingled with
                    hail created such disorder in both the lines, that the troops, scarcely able to

                    this circumstance as a Divine interposition, and it is reported that Hannibal
                    was heard to say, <quote> That sometimes he wanted the will to make himself

                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Two other circumstances also, one
                    inconsiderable, the other important, diminished his hopes. The important one
                    was, that while he lay with his armed troops near the walls of the city, he was
                    informed that troops had marched out of it with colours flying, as a
                    reinforcement for Spain; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> that of less
                    importance was, that he was informed by one of his prisoners, that the very
                    ground on which his camp stood was sold at this very time, without any
                    diminution in its price. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Indeed, so great an
                    insult and indignity did it appear to him that a purchaser should be found at
                    Rome for the very soil which he held and possessed by right of conquest, that he
                    immediately called a crier, and ordered that the silversmiths' shops, which at
                    that time stood around the Roman forum, should be put up for sale. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> Induced by these circumstances he retired to the
                    river Tutia, six miles from the city, whence he proceeded to the grove of
                    Feronia, where was a temple at that time celebrated for its riches. <milestone

                    according to their abilities, kept it decorated with abundance of gold and
                    silver. Of all these offerings the temple was now despoiled. After the departure
                    of Hannibal, vast heaps of brass were found there, as the soldiers, from a

                    but Caelius asserts, that Hannibal, in his progress to Rome, turned out of his
                    way to it from Eretum. According to him his route commenced with Amiternum,
                    Caetilii, <pb n="1032" xml:id="p.1032"/> and Reate. <milestone n="11"

                        inflicted upon their allies had no effect in calling them off. He ordered

                        from them, unless they gave up Capua. But they did not give it up. Wild

                        unit="section"/> He thought it right also, that the fathers should have the
                    opportunity of asking them whether any of the Latin confederates, or of the
                    municipal towns, had taken part in these designs, and whether they had derived
                    any assistance from them in the war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Fulvius,
                    on the contrary, urged that they ought by no means to run the hazard of having
                    the minds of faithful allies harassed by doubtful accusations, and subjected to
                    informers who never cared at all what they did or what they said. For this
                    reason he said that he should prevent and put a stop to any such inquiry.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> After this conversation they separated;
                    Appius not doubting but that his colleague, though he expressed himself so
                    warmly, would, nevertheless, wait for a letter from Rome, in an affair of such
                    magnitude. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But Fulvius, fearing that his
                    designs would be frustrated by that very means, dismissed his council, and
                    commanded the military tribunes and the praefects of the allies to give notice
                    to two thousand chosen horsemen to be in readiness at the third trumpet.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Setting out for Teanum with this body of
                    cavalry, he entered the gate at break of day, and proceeded direct to the forum;
                    and a number of people having flocked together at the first entrance of the
                    horsemen, he ordered the Sidicinian magistrate to be summoned; when he desired
                    him to bring forth the Campanians whom he had in custody. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> These were all accordingly brought forth, scourged, and
                    beheaded. He then proceeded at full speed to Cales; where, <pb n="1038"
                        xml:id="p.1038"/> when he had taken his seat on the tribunal, and while the
                    Campanians, who had been brought forth, were being bound to the stake, an
                    express arrived from Rome, and delivered to him a letter from Caius Calpurnius,
                    the praetor, and a decree of the senate. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> A
                    murmur immediately pervaded the whole assembly, beginning at the tribunal, that
                    the entire question respecting the Campanians was referred to the decision of
                    the fathers; and Fulvius, suspecting this to be the case, took the letter, and
                    without opening it put it into his bosom, and then commanded the crier to order
                    the lictor to do his duty. Thus punishment was inflicted on those also who were
                    at Cales. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The letter was then read, together
                    with the decree of the senate, when it was too late to prevent the business
                    which was already executed, and which had been accelerated by every means to
                    prevent its being obstructed. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> When Fulvius
                    was now rising from his seat, Jubellius Taurea, a Campanian, making his way
                    through the middle of the city and the crowd, called upon him by name;
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and when Flaccus, who wondered greatly
                    what he could want, had resumed his seat, he said, <quote> Order me also to be

                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Fulvius at first said, that the man could not

                    from the noise which was made, ordered silence; when Taurea <pb n="1039"

                    it, to the effect, that if he thought proper he should refer the entire question
                    to the senate, he construed it that the decision as to what was most for the
                    interest of the state was left to himself. He returned from Cales to Capua.
                    Atella and Calatia surrendered themselves, and were received. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Here also the principal promoters of the revolt were
                    punished. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Thus eighty principal members of the
                    senate were put to death; and about three hundred of the Campanian nobles thrown
                    into prison. The rest were distributed through the several cities of the Latin
                    confederacy, to be kept in custody; where they perished in various ways. The
                    rest of the Campanian citizens were sold. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                    remaining subject of deliberation related to the city and its territory. Some
                    were of opinion that a city so eminently powerful, so near, and so hostile,
                    ought to be demolished. But immediate utility prevailed; for on account of the
                    land, which was evidently superior to any in Italy from the variety and
                    exuberance of its produce, the city was preserved that it might become a
                    settlement of husbandmen. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> For the purpose of
                    peopling the city, a number of sojourners, freed-men, dealers, and artificers,
                    were retained; but all the land and buildings were made the property of the
                    Roman state. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> It was resolved, however, that
                    Capua should only be inhabited and peopled as a city; that there should be no

                    of any common rights, would be incapable of combination. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> They resolved to send a prefect annually from Rome to

                    with rigour and despatch; the populace dispersed beyond all hope of return; no

                    six thousand foot and three hundred horse, whichever he should himself choose
                    out of those two legions which he had commanded at Capua, with an equal number
                    of infantry, and eight hundred horse of the Latin confederacy. This army Nero
                    embarked at Puteoli, and conveyed over into Spain. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Having arrived at Tarraco with his ships, landed his

                    he proceeded to the river Iberus, and received the army from Titus Fonteius and
                    Lucius Marcius. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He then marched towards the
                    enemy. Hasdrubal, son of Hamilcar, was encamped at the black stones in
                    Ausetania, a place situated between the towns Illiturgi and Mentissa. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> The entrance of this defile Nero seized; and
                    Hasdrubal, to prevent his being shut up in it, sent a herald to engage that, if
                    he were allowed to depart thence, he would convey the whole of his army out of
                    Spain. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Roman general having received this
                    proposition gladly, Hasdrubal requested the next day for a conference, when the

                    the surrender of the citadels of the towns, and the appointment of a day on
                    which the garrisons might be withdrawn, and the Carthaginians might remove every
                    thing belonging to them without imposition. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Having obtained his point in this respect, Hasdrubal gave orders that as soon as
                    it was dark, and during the whole of the night afterwards, the heaviest part of
                    his force should get out of the defile by whatever way they could. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> The strictest care was taken that many should not go
                    out that night, that the very fewness of their numbers might both be more
                    adapted to elude the notice of the enemy from their silence, and to an escape
                    through confined and rugged paths. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Next day
                    they met for the confer- <pb n="1041" xml:id="p.1041"/> ence; but that day
                    having been spent, on purpose, in speaking and writing about a variety of
                    subjects, which were not to this point, the conference was put off to the next
                    day. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The addition of the following night gave
                    him time to send still more out; nor was the business concluded the next day.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Thus several days were spent in openly
                    discussing conditions, and as many nights in privately sending the Carthaginian
                    troops out of their camp; and after the greater part of the army had been sent
                    out, he did not even keep to those terms which he had himself proposed; and his
                    sincerity decreasing with his fears, they became less and less agreed.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> By this time nearly all the infantry had
                    cleared the defile, when at daybreak a dense mist enveloped the whole defile and
                    the neighbouring plains; which Hasdrubal perceiving, sent to Nero to put off the
                    conference to the following day, as the Carthaginians held that day sacred from
                    the transaction of any serious business. Not even then was the cheat suspected.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal having gained the indulgence he
                    sought for that day also, immediately quitted his camp with his cavalry and
                    elephants, and without creating any alarm escaped to a place of safety.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> About the fourth hour the mist, being
                    dispelled by the sun, left the atmosphere clear, when the Romans saw that the

                    length Claudius, recognising the Carthaginian perfidy, and perceiving that he
                    had been caught by trickery, immediately began to pursue the enemy as they moved
                    off, prepared to give battle; but they declined fighting. <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/> Some skirmishes, however, took place between the rear of

                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At Rome, the attention of the senate and
                    people, after the recovery of Capua, was not fixed in a greater degree upon
                    Italy than upon Spain. They resolved that the army there should be augmented and
                    a general sent. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They were not, however, so
                    clear as to the person whom they should send, as that, where two generals had
                    fallen within the space of thirty days, he who was to supply the place of them
                    should be selected with unusual care. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Some

                    of electing a proconsul for Spain; and the consuls fixed a day for the election.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At first they waited in expectation that
                    those persons who might think themselves qualified for so momentous a command
                    would give in their names; but this expectation being disappointed, their grief
                    was renewed for the calamity they had suffered, and their regret for the
                    generals they had lost. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The people thus
                    afflicted, and almost at their wits' end, came down, however, to the Campus
                    Martius on the day of the election; where, turning towards the magistrates, they
                    looked round at the countenances of their most eminent men, who were earnestly
                    gazing at each other; and murmured bitterly, that their affairs were in so
                    ruinous a state, and the condition of the commonwealth so desperate, that no one
                    dared undertake the command in Spain. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When
                    suddenly Publius Cornelius, son of Publius who had fallen in Spain, who was
                    about twenty-four years of age, declaring himself a candidate, took his station
                    on an eminence from which he could be seen by all. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The eyes of the whole assembly were directed towards him,
                    and by acclamations and expressions of approbation, a prosperous and happy
                    command were at once augured to him. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Orders
                    were then given that they should proceed to vote, when not only every century,
                    but every individual to a man, decided that Publius Scipio should be invested
                    with the command in Spain. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But after the

                    subsided, a sudden silence ensued, and a secret reflection on what they had

                    subsided, and inspire the people with more confident hopes than the reliance

                        unit="section"/> For Scipio was not only deserving of admiration for his
                    real virtues, but also for his peculiar address in displaying them, to which he
                    had been formed from his earliest years; —effecting <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> many things with the multitude, either by feigning
                    nocturnal visions or as with a mind divinely inspired; whether it was that he
                    was himself, too, endued with a superstitious turn of mind, or that they might
                    execute his commands and adopt his plans without hesitation, as if they
                    proceeded from the responses of an oracle. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    With the intention of preparing men's minds for this from the beginning, he
                    never at any time from his first assumption of the manly gown transacted any
                    business, public or private, without first going to the Capitol, entering the
                    temple, and taking his seat there; where he generally passed a considerable time
                    in secret and alone. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This practice, which was
                    adhered to through the whole of his life, occasioned in some persons a belief in
                    a notion which generally prevailed, whether designedly or undesignedly
                    propagated, that he was a man of divine extraction; <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> and revived a report equally absurd and fabulous with that
                    formerly spread respecting Alexander the Great, that he was begotten by a huge
                    serpent, whose monstrous form was frequently observed in the bedchamber of his
                    mother, but which, on any one's coming in, suddenly unfolding his coils, glided
                    out of sight. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The belief in these miraculous
                    accounts was never ridiculed by him, but rather increased by his address;
                    neither positively denying any such thing nor openly affirming it. There were
                    also many other things, some real and others counterfeit, which exceeded in the
                    case of this young man the usual measure of <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/>
                    human admiration, in reliance on which the state intrusted him with an affair of
                    so much difficulty, and with so important a command, at an age by no means ripe
                    for it. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> To the forces in Spain, consisting of

                    by Claudius Nero, ten thousand infantry and a thousand horse were added; and
                    Marcus Junius Silanus, the proprietor, was sent to assist in the management of
                    affairs. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Thus with a fleet of thirty ships,
                    all of which were quinqueremes, he set sail from the mouth of the Tiber, and

                    then doubling the promontory of the Pyrenees, landed his troops at Emporiae, a

                    from Phocaea. Ordering his ships to attend him, he marched by land to Tarraco;
                    where he held a congress of deputies from all the allies; for embassies had
                    poured forth from every province on the news of his arrival. <milestone n="12"

                    confidence he had in his own talents, that no presumptuous expression ever

                    highest commendations upon the soldiers, because, though they had received two

                    had retained possession of the province, and not allowing the enemy to reap any
                    advantage from their successes, had excluded them entirely from the territory on
                    this side of the Iberus, and honourably protected their allies. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> Marcius he kept with him, and treated him with such
                    respect, that it was perfectly evident there was nothing he feared less than
                    lest any one should stand in the way of his own glory. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> Silanus then took the place of Nero, and the fresh troops
                    were led into winter quarters. Scipio having in good time visited every place
                    where his presence was necessary, and completed every thing which was to be
                    done, returned to Tarraco. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The reputation of
                    Scipio among his enemies was not inferior to that which he enjoyed among his
                    allies and countrymen. They felt also a kind of presentiment of what was to
                    come, which occasioned the greater apprehension, the less they could account for
                    their fears, which had arisen without any cause. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                    /> They had retired to their winter quarters in different directions. Hasdrubal,
                    son of Gisgo, had gone quite to the ocean and Gades; Mago into the midland parts
                    chiefly above the forest of Castulo; Hasdrubal, son of Hamilcar, wintered in the

                    Scipio entered Spain, a Carthaginian fleet, which had been fetched from Sicily
                    to Tarentum, to cut off the supplies <pb n="1045" xml:id="p.1045"/> of the Roman
                    garrison in the citadel of that place, had blocked up all the approaches to the

                    long, they caused a greater scarcity of provisions to their friends than to

                    brought in for the townsmen, along the coasts which were friendly to them, and
                    through the ports which were kept open through the protection afforded by the
                    Carthaginian fleet, as the fleet itself consumed, which had on board a crowd
                    made up of every description of persons. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> So
                    that the garrison of the citadel, which was small in number, could be supported
                    from the stock they had previously laid in without importing any, while that
                    which they imported was not sufficient for the supply of the Tarentines and the

                    greater satisfaction than it was received. The scarcity of provisions, however,
                    was not much relieved by it; because when the protection by sea was removed corn
                    could not be brought in. </p>

                    to triumph, as if the war had been terminated, when the army, the evidence of

                    been adorned in such a manner as to rank among the chief Grecian cities in that

                    Mericus, the Spaniard, who preceded him with golden crowns, formed not the least

                    had entered Syracuse by night, while the other had betrayed to them the island

                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Seven shops, where five were afterwards
                    erected, and the banks, which are now called the new banks, were all on fire at
                    once. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Afterwards the private dwellings caught,
                    for there were no public halls there then, the prisons called the Quarry, the
                    fish-market, and the royal palace. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The temple
                    of Vesta was with difficulty saved, principally by the exertions of thirteen
                    slaves, who were redeemed at the public expense and manumitted. The fire
                    continued for a day and a night. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was
                    evident to every body that it was caused by human contrivance, because the
                    flames burst forth in several places at once, and those at a distance from each
                    other. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The consul, therefore, on the

                    by whose act the conflagration was kindled, should be rewarded; if a free-man,
                    with money, if a slave, with liberty. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Induced
                    by this reward, a slave of the Campanian family, the Calavii, named Mannus, gave
                    information that <quote> his masters, with five noble Campanian youths, whose
                        parents had been executed by Fulvius, were the authors of the fire, and that
                        they would commit various other acts of the same kind if they were not
                        seized. </quote> Upon this they were seized, as well as their slaves.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At first, the informer and his evidence
                    were disparaged; for that "he had run away from his masters the day before in
                    consequence of a whipping, and that from an event which had happened by mere
                    chance, he had fabricated this charge, from resentment and wantonness.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> But when they were charged by their

                    in the middle of the forum, they all confessed; and punishment was inflicted
                    upon the masters and their accessory slaves. The informer received his liberty

                    was surrounded by a multitude of Campanians, who besought him, with tears, that
                    they might be permitted to go to Rome to the senate, so that if they could at
                    length be in any degree moved by compassion, they might not carry their

                        had the same feelings towards the Roman people; for that there was no nation

                        country like wild beasts, tearing and massacring whatever fell in their way.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> That some of them had deserted to

                        in the shrine, had been the objects of their attack. That in his opinion it
                        was extremely unsafe for any Campanians to be allowed to enter the walls of

                    <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Laevinus ordered the Campanians to follow him

                    accusers of two men who had acquired the greatest celebrity by the overthrow of
                    two most renowned cities, those whom they had vanquished in war. <milestone

                    Capua was decreed, with his command continued for a year. The army of citizens

                        should again go thither with command. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> That
                        he had formerly been implacable toward them for no demerit of theirs; what

                        him? That it would be better for that island to be overwhelmed with the
                        fires of Aetna, or sunk in the sea, than to be delivered up, as it were, for
                        execution to an enemy. </quote>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> These complaints of the Sicilians, having been
                    carried round to the houses of the nobility, and frequently canvassed in
                    conversations, which were prompted partly by compassion for the Sicilians and

                        might have been different, but as the case now stood, lest any one should be

                        have the power of selecting his province without drawing lots, how much
                        greater injustice would it be, nay, rather indignity, for his lot to be

                    might add to the glory of that man, from whom he derived the reputation of

                    days. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> So great was the murmuring and
                    indignation of the people, on account of this edict, that a leader, rather than

                        drained as they had been for so many years by taxes, they had nothing left
                        but wasted and naked lands. That the enemy had burned their houses, and the

                        at one time by purchasing them at a low rate for soldiers, at another by

                    If the state is preserved, she can easily secure the property of her individual

                    any edict, or coercion of the magistrates, the state neither wanted rowers to
                    make up the numbers, nor money to pay them; and after every thing had been got

                    both the Carthaginians and the Romans, plunged alike in vicissitudes, were in a
                    state of more anxious suspense between hope and fear. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> For on the side of the Romans, with respect to their
                    provinces, their failure in Spain on the one hand, and their successes in Sicily
                    on the other, had blended joy and sorrow; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and
                    in Italy, the loss of Tarentum was an injury and a source of grief to them,
                    while the unexpected preservation of the citadel with the garrison was matter of
                    joy to them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The sudden terror and panic
                    occasioned by the siege and attack of Rome, was turned into joy by the capture
                    of Capua, a few days after. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Their affairs
                    beyond sea also were equalized by a kind of compensation. Philip had become
                    their enemy at a juncture somewhat unseasonable; but then the Aetolians, and
                    Attalus, king of Asia, were added to their allies; fortune now, in a manner,
                    promising to the Romans the empire of the east. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                    /> The Carthaginians also set the loss of Capua against the capture of Tarentum;
                    and as they consi- <pb n="1067" xml:id="p.1067"/> dered it as glorious to them
                    to have reached the walls of Rome without opposition, so they were chagrined at
                    the failure of their attempt; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> and they felt
                    ashamed that they had been held in such contempt, that while they lay under the
                    walls of Rome, a Roman army was marched out for Spain at an opposite gate.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> With regard also to Spain itself, the
                    greater the reason was to hope that the war there was terminated, and that the
                    Romans were driven from the country, after the destruction of two such renowned
                    generals and their armies, so much the greater was the indignation felt, that
                    the victory had been rendered void and fruitless by Lucius Marcius, a general
                    irregularly appointed. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Thus fortune balancing
                    events against each other, all was suspense and uncertainty on both sides; their
                    hopes and their fears being as strong as though they were now first commencing
                    the war. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> What grieved Hannibal more than anything was
                    the fact, that Capua having been more perseveringly besieged by the Romans than
                    defended by him, had turned from him the regard of many of the states of Italy;
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> and it was not only impossible for him to
                    retain possession of all these by means of garrisons, unless he could make up
                    his mind to tear his army into a number of small portions, which at that time
                    was most inexpedient; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> but he could not, by
                    withdrawing the garrisons, leave the fidelity of his allies open to the
                    influence of hope, or subject to that of fear. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    His disposition, which was strongly inclined to avarice and cruelty, induced him
                    to plunder the places he could not keep possession of, that they might be left
                    for the enemy in a state of desolation. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This
                    resolution was equally horrid in principle and in its issue; for not only were
                    the affections of those who suffered such harsh treatment alienated from him,
                    but also of the other states; for the warning affected a greater number than did
                    the calamity. Nor did the Roman consul fail to sound the inclinations of the
                    cities, whenever any prospect of success presented itself. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Dasius and Blasius were the principal men in Salapia;
                    Dasius was the friend of Hannibal; Blasius, as far as he could do it with
                    safety, promoted the Roman interest; and, by means of secret messengers, had
                    given Marcellus hopes of having the place betrayed to him; but the business
                    could not be accomplished without the assistance of Dasius. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> After much and long hesitation, and <pb n="1068"
                        xml:id="p.1068"/> even then more for the want of a better plan than from any
                    hope of success, he addressed himself to Dasius; but he, being both adverse to
                    the measure and also hostile to his rival in the government, discovered the
                    affair to Hannibal. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Both parties were
                    summoned, and while Hannibal was transacting some business on his tribunal,
                    intending presently to take cognizance of the case of Blasius, and the accuser
                    and the accused were standing apart from the crowd, which was put back, Blasius
                    solicited Dasius on the subject of surrendering the city; <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> when he exclaimed, as if the case were now clearly proved,
                    that he was being treated with about the betrayal of the city, even before the
                    eyes of Hannibal. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The more audacious the
                    proceeding was, the less probable did it appear to Hannibal and those who were
                    present. They considered that the charge was undoubtedly a matter of rivalry and
                    animosity, and that it had been brought because it was of such a nature that,
                    not admitting of being proved by witnesses, it could the more easily be
                    fabricated. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Accordingly the parties were
                    dismissed. But Blasius, notwithstanding, desisted not from his bold undertaking,
                    till by continually harping upon the same subject, and proving how conducive
                    such a measure would be to themselves and their country, he carried his point
                    that the Punic garrison, consisting of five hundred Numidians, and Salapia,
                    should be delivered up to Marcellus. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Nor
                    could it be betrayed without much bloodshed, consisting of the bravest of the
                    cavalry in the whole Punic army. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Accordingly,
                    though the event was unexpected, and their horses were of no use to them in the
                    city, yet hastily taking arms, during the confusion, they endeavoured to force
                    their way out; and not being able to escape, they fell fighting to the last, not
                    more than fifty of them falling into the hands of the enemy alive. <milestone
                        n="14" unit="section"/> The loss of this body of cavalry was considerably
                    more detrimental to Hannibal than that of Salapia, for the Carthaginian was
                    never afterwards superior in cavalry, in which he had before been most

                    was stationed at Rhegium. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Decius Quinctius, a
                    man of obscure birth, but who had acquired great renown as a soldier, on account
                    of many acts of bravery, had charge of the fleet and the convoys. <milestone

                    two triremes, given to him by Marcellus; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> but
                    afterwards, in consequence of his spirited conduct on many occasions, three
                    quinqueremes were added to his number; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> at
                    last, by exacting from the allied states of Rhegium, Velia, and Paestum, the
                    ships they were bound to furnish according to treaty, he made up a fleet of

                    setting out from Rhegium, was met at Sacriportus, about fifteen miles from the
                    city, by Democrates, with an equal number of Tarentine ships. It happened that
                    the Roman was then coming with his sails up, not expecting an approaching
                    contest; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> but in the neighbourhood of Croto and
                    Sybaris, he had supplied his ships with rowers, and had his fleet excellently
                    equipped and armed for the size of his vessels; <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                    /> and it also happened, that just at the time when the enemy were in sight, the
                    wind completely fell, so that there was sufficient time to furl their sails, and
                    get their rowers and soldiers in readiness for the approaching action. Rarely
                    elsewhere have regular fleets engaged with so much spirit, for they fought for
                    what was of greater importance than the fleets themselves. <milestone n="9"

                    from the Romans after the lapse of almost a century, they might also rescue
                    their citadel; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> hoping also to cut off the
                    supplies of their enemy, if by a naval battle they could deprive them of the
                    dominion of the sea. The Romans, that, by keeping possession of the citadel,
                    they might prove that Tarentum was lost not by the strength and valour of their
                    enemies, but by treachery and stealth. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly, the signal having been given on both sides, they charged each other
                    with the beaks of their ships, and neither did they draw back their own, nor
                    allow the ships of the enemy with which they were engaged to separate from them,
                    having thrown their grappling irons; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and thus
                    the battle was carried on in such close quarters, that they fought not only with
                    missile weapons, but in a manner foot to foot even with their swords. The prows
                    joined together remained stationary, while the sterns were moved round by the
                    force of their adversaries' oars. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The ships
                    were crowded together in so small a com- <pb n="1070" xml:id="p.1070"/> pass,
                    that scarcely one weapon fell into the sea without taking effect. They pressed
                    front against front like lines of troops engaging on land, and the combatants
                    could pass from one ship to another. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> But the
                    contest between two ships which had engaged each other in the van, was
                    remarkable above the rest. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> In the Roman ship
                    was Quinctius himself, in the Tarentine, Nico, surnamed Perco, who hated, and
                    was hated by, the Romans, not only on public grounds, but also personally, for
                    he belonged to that faction which had betrayed Tarentum to Hannibal. This man
                    transfixed Quinctius with a spear while off his guard, and engaged at once in
                    fighting and encouraging his men, and he immediately fell headlong with his arms
                    over the prow. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> The victorious Tarentine
                    promptly boarded the ship, which was all in confusion from the loss of the
                    commander, <milestone n="17??" unit="section"/> and when he had driven the enemy
                    back, and the Tarentines had got possession of the prow, the Romans, who had
                    formed themselves into a compact body, with difficulty defending the stern,
                    suddenly another trireme of the enemy appeared at the stern. <milestone n="18"
                        unit="section"/> Thus the Roman ship, enclosed between the two, was
                    captured. Upon this a panic spread among the rest, seeing the commander's ship
                    captured, and flying in every direction, some were sunk in the deep and some
                    rowed hastily to land, where, shortly after, they became a prey to the Thurians
                    and Metapontines. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Of the storeships which
                    followed, laden with provisions, a very few fell into the hands of the enemy;
                    the rest, shifting their sails from one side to another with the changing winds,
                    escaped into the open sea. An affair took place at Tarentum at this time, which
                    was attended with widely different success; <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    for a party of four thousand men had gone out to forage, and while they were
                    dispersed, and roaming through the country, Livius, the commander of the citadel
                    and the <milestone n="21??" unit="section"/> Roman garrison, who was anxious to
                    seize every opportunity of striking a blow, sent out of the citadel Caius
                    Persius, an active officer, with two thousand soldiers, who attacked them
                    suddenly when widely dispersed and straggling about the fields; <milestone

                    drove the few that remained of so many into the city, to which they fled in
                    alarm and confusion, and where they rushed in at the doors of the gates, which
                    were half-opened that the city might not be taken in the same attack. <milestone

                    and the Tarentines by sea. Both parties were equally disappointed in their hope
                    of receiving provisions, after they were within sight. </p>

                    Laevinus, after a great part of the year had elapsed, having arrived in Sicily,
                    where he had been expected by both the old and new allies, considered it his
                    first and principal duty to adjust the affairs of Syracuse, which were still in
                    a state of disorder, the peace being but recent. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                    /> He then marched his legions to Agrigentum, the seat of the remaining part of
                    the war, which was occupied by a strong garrison of Carthaginians; <milestone

                    commander-in- chief of the Carthaginians, but their whole reliance was placed
                    upon Mutines and the Numidians. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Mutines,
                    scouring the whole of Sicily, employed himself in carrying off spoil from the
                    allies of the Romans; nor could he by force or stratagem be cut off from
                    Agrigentum, or prevented from sallying from it whenever he pleased. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> The renown which he gained by this conduct, as it
                    began now to eclipse the fame of the commander-in-chief, was at last converted
                    into a source of jealousy; so that even now his successes were not as acceptable
                    as they ought to have been, on account of the person who gained them. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> For these reasons Hanno at last gave his commission
                    to his own son, concluding that by taking away his command he should also
                    deprive him of the influence he possessed with the Numidians. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> But the result was very different; for their former
                    attachment to him was increased by the envy incurred by him. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Nor did he brook the affront put upon him by this injurious
                    treatment, but immediately sent secret messengers to Laevinus, to treat about
                    delivering up Agrigentum. After an agreement had been entered into by means of
                    these persons, and the mode of carrying it into execution concerted, the Nu-
                    midians seized on a gate which leads towards the sea, having driven the guards
                    from it, or put them to the sword, and then received into the city a party of
                    Romans sent for that purpose; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and when these
                    troops were now marching into the heart of the city and the forum with a great
                    noise, Hanno, concluding that it was nothing more than a disturbance and
                    secession of the Numidians, such as had happened before, advanced to quell <pb
                        n="1072" xml:id="p.1072"/> the mutiny; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    but observing at a distance that the numbers were greater than those of the
                    Numidians, and hearing the Roman shout, which was far from being new to him, he
                    betook himself to flight before he came within reach of their weapons.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Passing out of the town at a gate in the
                    opposite quarter, and taking Epicydes to accompany him, he reached the sea with
                    a few attendants; and having very seasonably met with a small vessel, they
                    abandoned to the enemy Sicily, for which they had contended for so many years,
                    and crossed over into Africa. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The remaining
                    multitude of Carthaginians and Sicilians fled with headlong haste, but as every
                    passage by which they could escape was blockaded up, they were cut to pieces
                    near the gates. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> On gaining possession of the
                    town, Laevinus scourged and beheaded those who took the lead in the affairs of
                    Agrigentum. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The rest, together with the
                    booty, he sold. All the money he sent to Rome. Accounts of the sufferings of the
                    Agrigentines spreading through all Sicily, all the states suddenly turned to the
                    Romans. In a short time twenty towns were betrayed to them, and six taken by
                    storm. As many as forty put themselves under their protection, by voluntary
                    surrender. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The consul having rewarded and
                    punished the leading men of these states, according to their several deserts,
                    and compelled the Sicilians, now that they had at length laid aside arms, to
                    turn their attention to the cultivation of their lands, <milestone n="16??"
                        unit="section"/> in order that the island might by its produce not only
                    maintain its inhabitants, but, as it had frequently done on many former
                    occasions, add to the supplies of Rome and Italy, he returned into Italy, taking
                    with him a disorderly multitude from Agathyrna. <milestone n="17" unit="section"
                    /> These were as many as four thousand men, made up of a mixed assemblage of
                    every description of persons, exiles, bankrupts, the greater part of them
                    felons, who had supported themselves by rapine and robbery, both when they lived
                    in their native towns, under the restraint of the laws, and also after that a
                    coincidence in their fortunes, brought about by causes different in each case,
                    had congregated them at Agathyrna. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> These men
                    Laevinus thought it hardly safe to leave in the island, when an unwonted
                    tranquillity was growing up, as the materials of fresh disturbances; and
                    besides, they were likely to be useful to the Rhegians, who were in want of a
                    band of men <pb n="1073" xml:id="p.1073"/> habituated to robbery, for the
                    purpose of committing depredations upon the Bruttian territory. Thus, so far as

                        from mine; inasmuch as there my father and uncle were both slain within the

                        of ancient date with Porsena, the Gauls, and Samnites. I will begin with the
                        Punic wars. How many fleets, generals, and armies were lost in the former
                        war? <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Why should I mention what has
                        occurred in this present war? I have either been myself present at all the
                        defeats sustained, or have felt more than any other those from which I was
                        absent. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> What else are the Trebia, the
                        Trasimenus, and Cannas, but monuments of Roman armies and consuls slain? Add
                        to these the defection of Italy, of the greater part of Sicily and Sardinia,
                        and the last terror and panic, the Carthaginian camp pitched between the
                        Anio and the walls of Rome, and the victorious Hannibal seen almost in our
                        gates. Amid this general ruin, the courage of the Roman people alone stood
                        unabated and unshaken. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> When every thing
                        lay prostrate on the ground, it was this that raised and supported the
                        state. You, first of all, my soldiers, under the conduct and auspices of my
                        father, opposed Hasdrubal on his way to the Alps and Italy, after the defeat
                        of Cannae, who, had he formed a junction with his brother, the Roman name
                        would now have been extinct. These successes formed a counterpoise to those
                        defeats. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Now, by the favour of the gods,
                        every thing in Italy and Sicily is going on prosperously and successfully,
                        every day affording matter of fresh joy, and presenting things in a better
                        light. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> In Sicily, Syracuse and Agrigentum
                        have been captured, the enemy entirely expelled the island, and the province
                        placed again under the dominion of the Romans. In Italy, Arpi has been
                        recovered and Capua taken. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Hannibal has
                        been driven into the remotest corner of Bruttium, having fled thither all
                        the way from Rome, in the utmost confusion; and now he asks the gods no
                        greater boon than that he might be allowed to retire in safety, and quit the

                        may be equally associated in the honour of that epithet,) when calamities
                        crowded one upon another in quick succession, and even the gods themselves,
                        in a manner, took part with Hannibal, should now sink in spirits when every
                        thing is going on happily and prosperously? <milestone n="18" unit="section"
                        /> Even with regard to the events which have recently occurred, I could wish

                        me as to you. At the present time the immortal gods who preside over the
                        destinies of the Roman empire, who inspired all the centuries to order the
                        command to be given to me, those same gods, I say, by auguries and auspices,
                        and even by nightly visions, portend entire success and joy. <milestone
                            n="19" unit="section"/> My own mind also, which has hitherto been to me
                        the truest prophet, presages that Spain will be ours; that the whole
                        Carthaginian name will in a short time be banished from this land, and will
                        fill both sea and land with ignominious flight. <milestone n="20"
                            unit="section"/> What my mind presages spontaneously, is also supported
                        by sound reasoning. Their allies, annoyed by them, are by ambassadors
                        imploring our protection; their three generals, having differed so far as
                        almost to have abandoned each other, have divided their army into three

                    besides, conveniently situated, not only for a passage into Africa, but also
                    near a port sufficiently capacious for a fleet of any magnitude, and, for aught

                    Spain is a bay facing for the most part the south-west, about two thousand five

                    the eminence on which the city is built; which is washed in the east and south
                    by the sea, and on the west is enclosed by a lake which extends a little way

                    He then commended in the highest terms the valour of his soldiers, because that

                    Allucius to him, he said: <quote> To the dowry which you are about to receive
                        from your father-in-law, let these marriage presents also from me be added;
                    </quote> bidding him take away the gold and keep it for himself. <milestone

                    dismissed to his home, where he inspired his countrymen with the deserved
                    praises of Scipio, observing, <quote> that a most godlike youth had come among
                        them, who conquered every thing, not only by arms, but by kindness and
                        generosity. </quote>
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Accordingly, making a levy among his
                    dependants, he returned to Scipio after a few days, with fourteen hundred chosen

                    disposed of the captives, hostages, and booty, in accordance with his advice;
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> but when all these matters were
                    satisfactorily arranged, he gave him a quinquereme; and selecting from the
                    captives Mago, and about fifteen senators who had been made prisoners at the
                    same time with him, put them on board, and sent him to Rome with the news of his
                    victory. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He himself employed the few days he

                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> On the first day the legions under arms
                    performed evolutions through a space of four miles; on the second day he ordered
                    them to repair and clean their arms before their tents; on the third day they
                    engaged in imitation of a regular battle with wooden swords, throwing javelins
                    with the points covered with balls; on the fourth day they rested; on the fifth
                    they again performed evolutions under arms. This succession of exercise and rest
                    they kept up as long as they staid at Carthage. <milestone n="5" unit="section"

                        unit="section"/> Such exercises, both by sea and land, without the city
                    prepared their minds and bodies for war. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                    city itself was all bustle with warlike preparations, artificers of every
                    description being collected together in a public workshop. The general went
                    round to all the works with equal attention. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    At one time he was employed in the dock-yard with his fleet, at <pb n="1087"

                    with the greatest eagerness by a multitude of artificers both in the workshops,
                    and in the armoury and docks. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Having put these

                    Tarraco; and on his way thither was visited by a number of embassies, some of
                    which he dismissed, having given them answers on his journey, others he
                    postponed till his arrival at Tarraco; at which place he had appointed a meeting

                    The Carthaginian generals at first industriously suppressed the rumour of the
                    capture of Carthage; but afterwards, when it became too notorious to be
                    concealed or dissembled, they disparaged its importance by their language.
