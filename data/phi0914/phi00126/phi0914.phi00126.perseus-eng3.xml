                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The new consuls, Cn, Fulvius Centimalus
                        and P. Sulpicius Galba, entered upon office on the 15th of March, and at
                        once convened a meeting of the senate in the Capitol to discuss questions of
                        State, the conduct of the war and the distribution of the provinces and the
                        armies. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The retiring consuls-Q. Fulvius
                        and Appius Claudius-retained their commands and were instructed to prosecute
                        the siege of Capua unremittingly until they had effected its capture. The
                        recovery of this city was the main concern of the Romans now. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> What determined them was not only the bitter
                        resentment which its defection had evoked, a feeling which <milestone
                            n="4??" unit="section"/> was never more justified in the case of any
                        city, but also the certainty they felt that, as in its revolt it had drawn
                        many communities with it, owing to its greatness and strength, so its
                        recapture would create amongst these communities a feeling of respect for
                        the power whose sovereignty they had formerly acknowledged. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The praetors of the past year, M. Junius in Etruria and
                        P. Sempronius in Gaul, had their commands extended and were each to retain
                        the two legions they had. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> M. Marcellus was
                        to act as proconsul and finish the war in Sicily with the army which he had.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> If he needed reinforcements he was to
                        take them from the troops which P. Cornelius was commanding in Sicily, but
                        none were to be selected from those who had been forbidden by the <milestone
                            n="8??" unit="section"/> senate to take a furlough or return home before
                        the end of the war. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The province of Sicily
                        was assigned to C. Sulpicius, and he was to take over the two legions which
                        were with P. Cornelius; any reinforcements he needed were to be supplied
                        from the army of Cn. Fulvius which had been so disgracefully routed and cut
                        up the previous year in Apulia. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The
                        soldiers who had so disgraced themselves were placed under the same
                        conditions with regard to length of service as the survivors of Cannae. As
                        an additional brand of ignominy the men of both these armies were forbidden
                        to winter in towns or to construct winter quarters for themselves within ten
                        miles of any town. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The two legions which
                        Q. Mucius had commanded in Sardinia were given to L. Cornelius, and any
                        additional force he might require was to be raised by the consuls.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> T. Otacilius and M. Valerius were
                        ordered to cruise off the coasts of Sicily and Greece respectively with the
                        fleets and soldiers they had previously commanded. The former had a hundred
                        ships with two legions on board; the latter, fifty ships and one legion.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The total strength of the Roman
                        armies engaged on land and sea this year amounted to twenty-five legions.

                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> .At the beginning of the year a despatch
                        from L. Marcius was laid before the senate. The senators fully appreciated
                        the successful way in which he had conducted his operations, but a good many
                        of them were indignant at the honorific title he had assumed. <milestone
                            n="2" unit="section"/> The superscription of the letter was "The
                        propraetor to the senate," though the imperium had not been conferred upon
                        him by an order of the people nor with the sanction of the senate. An evil
                        precedent had been set, they said, when a commander was chosen by his army,
                        and the solemn procedure at elections, after the auspices were duly taken,
                            <milestone n="3??" unit="section"/> was transferred to camps and
                        provinces far away from the magistrates and the laws, and left to the
                        caprice of the soldiers. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Some thought the
                        senate ought to take the matter up, but it was thought better to adjourn the
                        consideration of it until the horsemen who had brought the despatch had left
                        the City. With regard to the food and clothing of the army, they ordered a
                        reply to be sent to the effect that both these matters would be attended to
                        by the senate. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They refused, however, to
                        allow the despatch to be addressed "To the propraetor L. Marcius," lest it
                        should appear that the question which was to be discussed had been
                        prejudged. After the messengers had been dismissed the consuls gave this
                        question priority over everything else, and it was unanimously agreed that
                        the tribunes should consult the plebs as soon as possible as to whom they
                        wished to have sent <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> to Spain with the
                        imperium as commander-in-chief to take over the army which Cn. Scipio had
                        commanded. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The tribunes undertook to do
                        so, and due notice of the question was given to the Assembly. But the
                        citizens were preoccupied with a controversy of a very different nature. C.
                        Sempronius Blaesus had fixed a day for bringing Cn. Fulvius to trial for
                        losing his army in Apulia, and made a very bitter attack upon him beforehand
                        in the Assembly. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> "Many commanders," he
                        said, "have through rashness and inexperience led their armies into most
                        dangerous positions, but Cn. Fulvius is the only one who has demoralised his
                        army by every form of vice before betraying them. They may with perfect
                        truth be said to have been destroyed before they saw the enemy; they owed
                        their defeat to their own commander, not to Hannibal. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> "Now no man, when he is going to vote,
                        takes sufficient trouble to find out what sort of a man it is to whom he is
                        entrusting the supreme command of the army. <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                        /> Think of the difference between Tiberius Sempronius and Cn. Fulvius.
                        Tiberius Sempronius had an army of slaves given to him, but in a short time,
                        thanks to the discipline he maintained and the wise use he made of his
                        authority, there was not a man amongst them who when he was in the field of
                        battle gave a thought to his birth or his condition. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> Those men were a protection to our allies and a terror
                        to our enemies. They snatched, as though from the very jaws of Hannibal,
                        cities like Cumae and Beneventum and restored them to Rome. Cn. Fulvius, on
                        the other hand, had an army of Roman citizens, born of respectable parents,
                        brought up as free men, and he infected them with the vices of slaves, and
                        made them such that they were <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> insolent
                        and riotous amongst our allies, weaklings and cowards in face of the enemy;
                        they could not stand even the war-cry of the Carthaginians, let alone their
                        charge. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Good heavens! no wonder the
                        soldiers gave ground, when their commander was the first to run away; the
                        wonder is that any stood their ground and fell, and that all did not
                        accompany Cn. Fulvius in his panic and flight. C. Flaminius, L. Paulus, L.
                        Postumius, and the two Scipios, Cnaeus and Publius, all chose to fall in
                        battle rather than desert their armies, when they were hemmed in by the foe.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Cn. Fulvius came back to Rome as the
                        all-but solitary herald of the annihilation of his army. After the army had
                        fled from the field of Cannae it was deported to Sicily, not to return till
                        the enemy had evacuated Italy, and a similar decree was recently passed in
                        the case of Fulvius' legions. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> But, shame
                        to relate, the commander himself remained unpunished after his flight from a
                        battle brought on by his own headstrong folly; he is free to pass the rest
                        of his life where he passed it in youth-in stews and brothels-whilst his
                        soldiers, whose only fault is that they copied their commander, are
                        practically sent into exile and have to undergo a service of disgrace.
                            <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> So unequal are the liberties enjoyed
                        in Rome by the rich and the poor, the men of rank and the men of the
                        people." </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In his defence Fulvius threw all the blame
                        upon his men. They clamoured, he said, for battle, and he led them out, not
                        at the moment, for it was late in the day, but on the following morning.
                        Though they were drawn up on favourable ground, at an early hour they found
                        either the terror of the enemy's name or the strength of his attack too much
                        for them. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When they were all flying in
                        disorder he was swept away by the rush as Varro was at Cannae and as many
                        other commanders have been at different times. What help would he have given
                        to the republic by staying there alone? <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        unless indeed his death would have warded off other national disasters. His
                        failure was not due to lack of supplies, or to incautiously taking up a
                        position on unfavourable ground; he had not been ambushed through
                        insufficient reconnoitring; he had been beaten in a fair fight on an open
                        field. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Men's tempers, on whichever side
                        they were, were beyond his control, a man's natural disposition made him
                        either brave or cowardly. The speeches of the prosecutor and the defendant
                        occupied two days, on the third day the witnesses were produced. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> Besides all the other serious charges brought
                        against him, a great many men stated on oath that the panic and flight began
                        with the praetor, and that when the soldiers found that they were left to
                        themselves, and thought that their commander had good ground for fear, they
                        too turned their backs and fled. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                        prosecutor had in the first instance asked for a fine, but the evidence
                        which had been given roused the anger of the people to such an extent that
                        they insisted upon a capital charge being laid. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> This led to a fresh contest. As the prosecutor during
                        the first two days had limited the penalty to a fine and only on the third
                        day made the charge a capital one, the defendant appealed to the other
                        tribunes, but they refused to interfere with their colleague. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> It was open to him by ancient custom to proceed
                        either by statute law or by customary precedent, whichever he preferred,
                        until he had obtained judgment, whether the penalty were a capital or a
                        pecuniary one. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On this Sempronius
                        announced that he should prosecute C. Fulvius on the charge of treason and
                        requested the City praetor to convene the Assembly for the purpose on the
                        appointed day. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Then the accused tried
                        another way of escape. His brother Quintus was in high favour with the
                        people at the time, owing to his former successes and the general conviction
                        that he would soon take Capua, and the defendant hoped that he might be
                        present at his trial. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Quintus wrote to
                        the senate for their permission, appealing to their compassion and begging
                        to be allowed to defend his brother's life, but they told him in reply that
                        it would militate against the interests of the State for him to leave Capua.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Just before the day of trial Cn.
                        Fulvius went into exile at Tarquinii. The plebs affirmed by resolution his
                        legal status as exile and all the consequences it involved. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Meanwhile the whole stress of the war bore
                        on Capua. The blockade was proving more effective than direct assault; the
                        common people and the slaves could not endure the famine, nor could they
                        send messengers to Hannibal owing to the strict watch which was kept.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At last a Numidian was found who
                        promised to get through with the despatches, and he succeeded. He escaped
                        through the Roman lines by night, and this encouraged the Capuans to attempt
                        sorties in all directions while they still had some strength left.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Numerous cavalry encounters took place
                        in which they generally had the advantage, but their infantry got the worst
                        of it. The gratification which the Romans derived from their infantry
                        successes was considerably damped by their finding themselves beaten in any
                        arm by an enemy whom they had invested and almost conquered. At length they
                        devised a clever plan by which they could make up for their inferiority in
                        the mounted arm. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Young men of exceptional
                        speed and agility were selected from all the legions and supplied with
                        bucklers somewhat shorter than those used by the cavalry. Each was furnished
                        with seven javelins, four feet long and tipped with iron heads similar to
                        those on the darts of the velites. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The
                        troopers each took one of these upon his horse and trained them to ride
                        behind and leap down briskly at a given signal. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> As soon as their daily training had given them
                        sufficient confidence, the cavalry advanced against the Capuans, who were
                        drawn up on the level ground between the Roman camp and the city walls.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As soon as they came within range the
                        signal was given and the velites sprang down to the ground. The line of
                        infantry thus formed made a sudden attack on the Capuan horse; shower after
                        shower of javelins was flung at the men and horses all along the line.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A great many were wounded, and the
                        novel and unexpected form of attack created widespread consternation. Seeing
                        the enemy shaken the Roman cavalry charged home, and in the rout that
                        followed they drove them with much loss right up to their gates. From that
                        time the Romans had the superiority in their cavalry also. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> The velites were subsequently incorporated in the
                        legions. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This plan of combining infantry
                        and cavalry in one force is said to have originated with one of the
                        centurions-Q. Navius, and he received special honour from his commander in
                        consequence. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Such was the position of affairs at Capua.
                        During this time Hannibal was drawn in two directions; he was anxious to get
                        possession of the citadel of Tarentum and he was equally anxious to retain
                        his hold on Capua. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Regard for Capua
                        however carried the day, for he saw that it was the spot to which all eyes
                        were turned, of friends and foes alike, and its fate would show
                        conclusively, one way or the other, the consequences of defection from Rome.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Leaving therefore his baggage and
                        heavy-armed troops in Bruttium, he hurried into Campania with a force of
                        horse and foot selected for their capacity for rapid marching. Swift as his
                        advance was, however, three and thirty elephants followed him. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> He took up his position in a secluded valley at
                        the back of Mount Tifata which overlooked Capua. On his march he captured
                        the fortified post of Calatia. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He then
                        turned his attention to the besiegers of Capua, and sent a message to the
                        city telling them at what time he intended to attack the Roman lines, so
                        that they might be ready to make a sortie and pour in full strength out of
                        all their gates. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The investing force was
                        thrown into a state of great alarm, for while Hannibal was delivering his
                        assault on one side, the whole of the forces of Capua, mounted and
                        unmounted, supported by the Punic garrison under Bostar and Hanno were
                        making a vigorous sortie on the other. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Realising their critical position and the danger of leaving a portion of
                        their lines unprotected by concentrating their defence in any one direction,
                        the Romans divided their force; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Appius
                        Claudius confronted the Capuans, Fulvius was opposed to Hannibal; the
                        propraetor C. Nero with the cavalry of the six legions held the road to
                        Suessula, and C. Fulvius Flaccus with the cavalry of the allies took up a
                        position towards the Volturnus. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There was
                        not only the usual shouting and uproar when the battle commenced; the din of
                        horses and men and arms was aggravated by the non-combatant population of
                        Capua. They crowded on to the walls, and by clashing brazen vessels
                        together, as people do in the dead of the night when there is an eclipse of
                        the moon, they made such a dreadful noise that it even distracted the
                        attention of the combatants. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Appius had no difficulty in driving the
                        Capuans from his earthworks, but Fulvius had to meet a much heavier attack
                        from Hannibal and his Carthaginians on the other side. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> Here the sixth legion gave way and a cohort of
                        Spaniards with three elephants succeeded in getting up to the breastwork.
                        They had penetrated the Roman line, and whilst they saw their chance of
                        breaking through into the camp they saw also the danger of being cut off
                        from their supports. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> When Fulvius saw the
                        disorder of the legion and the danger which threatened the camp, he called
                        upon Q. Navius and other centurions of the first rank to charge the enemy's
                        cohort which was fighting just under the breastwork. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> "It is a most critical moment," he told them; "either
                        you must allow the enemy to go on, in which case they will break into the
                        camp with less difficulty than they found in breaking through the closed
                        ranks of the legion, or you must dispose of them whilst they are still below
                        the breastwork. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> It will not be a hard
                        fight; they are a small body, cut off from their support; and the very fact
                        of the Roman line being broken will be an advantage if both sections close
                        on the enemy's flanks, who would then be hemmed and exposed to a double
                        attack." <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> On hearing this Navius took the
                        standard of the second maniple of hastati from the bearer and advanced with
                        it against the enemy, threatening at the same time to throw it into their
                        midst if his men did not promptly follow him and take their share in the
                        fighting. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> He was a huge man and his
                        armour set him off, and as he lifted the standard high in the air, he
                        attracted all eyes. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> But when he was close
                        to the Spaniards they hurled their javelins at him from all sides, and
                        almost the whole of their line turned their attention to this one man.
                        Neither the number of the enemy, however, nor the force of their missiles
                        were able to check the gallant fellow's onset. </p>

                        maniple of the sixth legion against the Spanish cohort; L. Porcius Licinius
                        and T. Popilius, who were in command of the camp, were keeping up a fierce
                        struggle in front of the breastwork, and killed some of the elephants whilst
                        they were actually clambering over it. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        Their bodies rolled down into the fosse and filled it up, making a bridge
                        for the passage of the enemy, and a terrible carnage began over the
                        prostrate elephants. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> On the other side of
                        the camp the Capuans and their Punic garrison had by this time been
                        repulsed, and the fighting went on right up to the city gate which leads to
                        the Volturnus. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The efforts of the Romans
                        to break in were frustrated not so much by the arms of the defenders as by
                        the ballistae and scorpions which were mounted over the gate and kept the
                        assailants at a distance by the missiles they discharged. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> A further check was given them by a wound received by
                        Appius Claudius; he was struck by a heavy javelin in the upper part of the
                        chest under the left shoulder, whilst he was riding along the front
                        encouraging his men. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> A great many of the
                        enemy were however killed outside the gate; the rest were driven in hasty
                        flight into the city. When Hannibal saw the destruction of his Spanish
                        cohort and the energy with which the Romans were defending their lines, he
                        gave up the attack and recalled the standards. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The retiring column of infantry was followed by the
                        cavalry who were to protect the rear in case the enemy harassed their
                        retreat. The legions were burning to pursue them, but Fulvius ordered the
                        "retire" to be sounded, as he considered that he had gained quite enough in
                        making both the Capuans and Hannibal himself realise how little he could do
                        in their defence. </p>

                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Some authors who describe this battle say
                        that 8000 of Hannibal's men were killed that day and 3000 Capuans, and that
                        15 standards were taken from the Carthaginians and 18 from the Capuans.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> In other accounts I find that the
                        affair was nothing like so serious, there was more excitement and confusion
                        than actual fighting. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> According to these
                        writers the Numidians and Spaniards broke unexpectedly into the Roman lines
                        with the elephants, and these animals, trotting all over the camp, upset the
                        tents and created terrible uproar and panic during which the baggage animals
                        broke their tethers and bolted. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> To add to
                        the confusion Hannibal sent some men got up as Italians, who could speak
                        Latin, to tell the defenders in the name of the consul that as the camp was
                        lost each man must do his best to escape to the nearest mountains.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The trick was, however, soon detected

                        Capua surrendered. The "medix tuticus," the supreme magistrate of Capua,
                        happened for that year to be Seppius Loesius, a man of humble birth and
                        slender fortune. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The story goes that
                        owing to a portent which had occurred in his mother's household she
                        consulted a soothsayer on behalf of her little boy, and he told her that the
                        highest official position in Capua would come to her son. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> As she was not aware of anything which would justify
                        such expectations she replied, "You are indeed describing a desperate state
                        of things in Capua when you say that such an honour will come to my son."
                            <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Her jesting reply to what was a true
                        prediction turned out itself to be true, for it was only when famine and
                        sword were pressing them sorely and all hope of further resistance was
                        disappearing that Loesius accepted the post. <milestone n="17"
                            unit="section"/> He was the last Capuan to hold it, and he only did so
                        under protest; Capua, he declared, was abandoned and betrayed by all her
                        foremost citizens. </p>

                        of his future movements when the idea occurred to him of marching upon Rome,
                        the head and guiding spirit of the whole war. He had always set his heart
                        upon this, and men blamed him for letting the opportunity slip, immediately
                        after the battle of Cannae; he himself admitted that he had made a mistake

                        at all events, one of them-would at once quit their hold on Capua.

                        possibility of the Capuans surrendering as soon as he had withdrawn.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Amongst his men there was a Numidian
                        who was ready for any desperate enterprise, and he induced this man, by the

                        and pointed out that his departure would be the means of saving them, as it
                        would draw off the Roman generals from their attack on Capua to defend Rome.

                        /> P. Valerius Flaccus advocated a middle course, which was ultimately
                        adopted. He recommended that a despatch should be sent to the generals
                        commanding at Capua, telling them what defensive force the City possessed.
                        They themselves would know what troops Hannibal was bringing and how large
                        an army was required to maintain the siege of Capua. <milestone n="7"

                        the City, the terrified population would have poured out of the gates. As it
                        was, they took refuge in the houses and various buildings, and seeing some
                        of their own people walking in the streets, they took them for enemies and

                        did not decline the challenge. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When both
                        sides were drawn up to decide an action in which Rome was the victor's
                        prize, a tremendous hailstorm threw the two armies into such disorder that
                        they had difficulty in holding their arms. They retired to their respective
                        camps, fearing everything rather than their enemy. The following day, when
                        the armies were drawn up in the same position, a similar storm separated
                        them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> On each occasion, after they were
                        once more in camp, the weather cleared up in an extraordinary way.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians looked upon the
                        occasion as preternatural, and the story runs that Hannibal was heard to say
                        that at one time he lacked the will, at another the opportunity, of becoming
                        master of Rome. His hopes were further damped by two incidents, one of some
                        importance, the other less so. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The more
                        important was his receiving information that while he was actually in arms
                        near the walls of Rome a force had marched out fully equipped, under their
                        standards, to reinforce the army in Spain. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The other incident, which he learnt from a prisoner, was the sale by auction
                        of the spot on which he had fixed his camp, and the fact that, in spite of
                        his occupation of it, there was no abatement in the price. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> That any one should have been found in Rome to buy the
                        ground which he was holding in possession as spoil of war, seemed to
                        Hannibal such an insulting piece of arrogance that he instantly summoned a
                        crier and made him give notice of the sale of the silversmiths' shops round
                        the Forum of Rome. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> These incidents led to his withdrawal from
                        Rome, and he retired as far as the river Tutia, six miles distant from the
                        City. From there he marched to the grove of Feronia and the temple, which
                        was celebrated in those days for its wealth. <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                        /> The people of Capena and other cities round used to bring their
                        first-fruits and other offerings, according to their ability, and they had
                        also embellished it with a considerable quantity of gold and silver. Now the
                        temple was despoiled of all its treasures. Great heaps of metal, where the
                        soldiers, struck by remorse, had thrown pieces of uncoined brass, were found
                        there after Hannibal's departure. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> All
                        writers are agreed as to the plundering of this temple. Coelius tell us that
                        Hannibal diverted his march to it while he was going from Eretum to Rome,
                        after marching from Amiternum by Reate and Cutiliae. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> According to this writer, on leaving Capua, Hannibal
                        entered Samnium, and from there passed to the Peligni; then, marching past
                        the town of Sulmo, he crossed the frontiers of the Marrucini and then
                        advanced through the Alban territory to the country of the Marsi, and from
                        there to Amiternum and the hamlet of Foruli. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> There can be no uncertainty as to the route he took,
                        for the traces of that great commander and his large army could not have
                        been lost in so short a space of time; <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        the only point at issue is whether that was the route he took when he
                        marched to Rome or whether he followed it on his return to Campania. </p>

                        the siege of Capua was far greater than that which Hannibal exhibited in its
                        defence, for he hurried away through Lucania to Bruttium in the hope of
                        surprising Regium. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Though the siege was in
                        no way relaxed during Fulvius' absence, his return made a sensible
                        difference in the conduct of operations, and it was a matter of general
                        surprise that Hannibal had not returned at the same time. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The Capuans gradually learnt through their
                        conversations with the besiegers that they were abandoned and left to
                        themselves, and that the Carthaginians had given up all hope of saving
                        Capua. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In accordance with a resolution of
                        the senate, the proconsul issued an edict which was published in the

                        went over to the Romans before a certain day would be amnestied. Not a
                        single man went over; their fears prevented them from trusting the Romans,
                        for they had in their revolt committed crimes too great for any hope of
                        pardon. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But whilst no one would provide
                        for his own safety by going over to the enemy, there was <milestone n="7??"
                            unit="section"/> nothing done for the public safety in the way of wise
                        or prudent counsel. The nobility had deserted their public duties; it was
                        impossible to get together a meeting of the senate. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> The supreme magistracy was held by a man who conferred
                        no honour on his office; on the contrary, his unfitness detracted from its
                        authority and power. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> None of the nobility
                        were to be seen in the forum, or indeed anywhere in public; they shut
                        themselves up at home waiting for their country's downfall and their own
                        destruction. All responsibility was thrown upon the commandants of the Punic
                        garrison, Bostar and Hanno, and they were much more <milestone n="10??"
                            unit="section"/> concerned for their own safety than for that of their
                        supporters in the city. A communication was drawn up for the purpose of
                        forwarding it to Hannibal, in which he was directly charged with
                        surrendering Capua into the enemy's hands and exposing his garrison to every
                        kind of torture. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He had gone off, so the
                        despatch hinted, to be out of the way, lest Capua should be taken before his
                        eyes, The Romans could not be drawn off from besieging Capua even when an
                        attack was threatened on their city; <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> so
                        much more determination did the Romans show as enemies, than the
                        Carthaginians as friends. If Hannibal would return to Capua and turn the
                        whole tide of war in that direction, then the garrison were prepared to make
                        an attack on the besiegers. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> He had not
                        crossed the Alps to make war with Regium or Tarentum; where the legions of
                        Rome were, there ought the armies of Carthage to be. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> That was how he had conquered at Cannae, and at
                        Thrasymenus, by meeting the enemy face to face, army to army, and trying his
                        fortune in battle. </p>
                    <p> This was the main drift of the despatch. It was handed to some Numidians who
                        had undertaken to carry it on promise of a reward. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> They had come into Fulvius' camp as deserters,
                        intending to seize a favourable opportunity of slipping away, and the famine
                        from which Capua had long been suffering was a very good reason why they
                        should desert. A Campanian woman, however, the mistress of one of these
                        deserters, suddenly appeared in the camp and informed the Roman commander
                        that the Numidians had come in as part of a pre-arranged plot, <milestone
                            n="16??" unit="section"/> and were really carrying a despatch to
                        Hannibal, and that she was prepared to prove it, as one of them had
                        disclosed the affair to her. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> When this
                        man was brought forward, he at first stoutly denied all knowledge of the
                        woman, but gradually he gave way before the truth, especially when he saw
                        that instruments of torture were being sent for and got ready, and at last
                        made a complete confession. The despatch was produced, and further evidence
                        came to light, as it was found that other Numidians were at large in the
                        Roman camp under the guise of deserters. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                        Above seventy of them were arrested and together with the recent arrivals
                        were all scourged, and their hands were cut off, after which they were sent
                        back to Capua. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> The sight of this terrible

                        everything, even Hannibal himself, and sent both the consuls, each with an
                        army, to Capua. For two years now have they hemmed us in with their lines of

                        they did not loose their hold on Capua; they did not loose their hold. When

                        approbation by many who had not the courage to carry out what they approved
                        of. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The majority of the senators were not
                        without hope that the clemency of the Roman people so often experienced in
                        former wars would be once more extended to them, and they determined to send
                        envoys to make a formal surrender of Capua. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                        /> About seven-and-twenty accompanied Virrius home and banqueted with him.
                        When they had as far as possible deadened their feelings with wine against
                        the sense of impending evil, they all partook of the poisoned cup.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then they rose from table and grasped
                        each other's hands and took a last embrace of one another, weeping for their
                        own and their country's doom. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Some
                        remained that they might be cremated together on the same funeral pyre,
                        others departed for their homes. The congestion of the veins caused by the
                        food and wine they had taken made the action of the poison somewhat slow,
                        and most of them lingered through the whole night and part of the following
                        day. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> All however, expired before the gates
                        were opened to the enemy. The following day, the gate called "the Gate of
                        Jupiter," opposite the Roman camp, was opened by the proconsul's order.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> One legion was admitted through it and
                        two squadrons of allied cavalry, with C. Fulvius in command. First he took
                        care that all the weapons of war in Capua were brought to him; then, after
                        stationing guards at all the gates to prevent any exit or escape, he
                        arrested the Punic garrison and ordered the senate to go to the Roman
                        commanders. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> On their arrival in the camp
                        they were manacled, and ordered to send word for all the gold and silver
                        they possessed to be brought to the quaestors. This amounted to 2072 pounds
                        of gold and 31,200 pounds of silver. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        Twenty-five senators were sent to be kept in custody at Cales, and
                        twenty-eight who were proved to have been mainly instrumental in bringing

                        the senators of Capua, Claudius and Fulvius were anything but unanimous.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Claudius was prepared to grant them
                        pardon, but Fulvius took a much sterner line. Appius Claudius wished to
                        refer the whole question to the senate at Rome. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> He maintained that it was but right that the senators
                        should have an opportunity of investigating all the circumstances and
                        finding out whether the Capuans had made any of the allies or the Latins or
                        the municipal burghs privy to their designs, and if so, whether any of these
                        had given them assistance in the war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        Fulvius, on the other hand, declared that the very last thing they ought to
                        do was to harass their faithful allies by vague charges and put them at the
                        mercy of informers who were perfectly indifferent as to what they said or
                        what they did. Any such investigation therefore he should stifle. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> After this interchange of views they parted,
                        Appius feeling no doubt that in spite of his violent language his comrade
                        would, in such an important matter, await instructions from Rome. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> Fulvius, determined to forestall any such
                        obstacle to his designs, dismissed the council and ordered the military
                        tribunes and the officers of the allies to select 2000 horsemen and warn
                        them to be in readiness by the time the third watch was sounded. Starting
                        with this force in the night, he reached Teanum at day-break and rode
                        straight into the forum. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> A crowd had
                        collected at the first entry of the cavalry, and Fulvius ordered the chief
                        magistrate of the district to be summoned, and on his appearance commanded
                        him to produce the Capuans who were in his custody. They were all brought
                        forward and then scourged and beheaded. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        Then putting spurs to his horse he rode to Cales. When he had taken his seat
                        on the tribunal and the Capuans who had been brought out were being bound to
                        the stake, a mounted messenger arrived post-haste from Rome and handed
                        Fulvius a despatch from the praetor C. Calpurnius containing the decree of
                        the senate. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The spectators guessed the
                        nature of the contents, and those standing round the tribunal expressed
                        their belief-a belief which soon found expression throughout the
                        Assembly-that the whole question of the treatment of the Capuan prisoners
                        was to be left to the senate. Fulvius thought so too; he took the letter and
                        without opening it placed it in his breast and then ordered his marshal to
                        tell the lictor to carry out the law. Thus, those who were at Cales were
                        also executed. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Now he read the despatch
                        and the decree of the senate. But it was too late to prevent a deed
                        accomplished, which had been hurried on as quickly as possible in order that
                        it might not be prevented. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Just as
                        Fulvius was leaving the tribunal a Capuan named Taurea Vibellius strode
                        through the middle of the crowd and addressed him by name. Fulvius resumed
                        his seat, wondering what the man wanted. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        "Order me too," he cried, to be put to death so that you may boast of having
                        caused the death of a braver man than yourself." <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> Fulvius declared that the man was certainly out of his
                        mind, and added that even if he wished to kill him he was prevented from
                        doing so by the decree of the senate. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        Then Vibellius exclaimed, "Now that my native city has been taken, my
                        friends and relations lost to me, my wife and children slain by my own hand
                        to save them from insult and outrage, and since even the opportunity of
                        dying as my fellow-countrymen here have died is refused me, let me seek in
                        courage a release from the life which has become so hateful to me."
                            <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> With these words he drew out a sword
                        which he had concealed in his garment, and plunging it into his heart fell
                        dying at the general's feet. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> As the execution of the Capuans and most
                        of the other steps taken were carried out by the instructions of Fulvius
                        alone, some authors assert that Appius Claudius died immediately after the
                        surrender of Capua. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> According to this
                        account, Taurea did not come voluntarily to Cales, nor did he perish by his
                        own hand; when he had been tied to the stake along with the others he
                        shouted repeatedly, and as owing to the noise they could not hear what he
                        was saying, Fulvius ordered silence. Then Taurea said, as I have already
                        related, that he was being done to death by a man who was far from being his
                        equal in courage. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> At these words, the
                        marshal, on the proconsul's order gave this direction to the lictor:
                        "Lictor, let this brave man have more of the rod, and execute the law upon
                        him first of all." <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Some authors assert
                        that the decree of the senate was read before the men were beheaded, but
                        there was a proviso in it to the effect that if he thought fit, he might
                        refer the question to the senate, and Fulvius took this to mean that he was
                        at liberty to decide as to what would be the best course in the interests of
                        the republic. After Fulvius returned to Capua, he received the submission of
                        Atella and Calatia. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Here too the
                        ringleaders in the revolt were punished; seventy of the leading senators
                        were put to death, and three hundred Campanian nobles thrown into prison.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Others who were distributed amongst
                        the various Latin cities to be kept in custody perished from various causes;
                        the rest of the population of Capua were sold as slaves. The question now
                        was what was to be done with the city and its territory. Some were of
                        opinion that a city so strong, so near to Rome and so hostile to it, ought
                        to be utterly destroyed. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Utilitarian
                        considerations however prevailed. The territory was generally allowed to be
                        the first in Italy in point of productiveness, and the only reason why the
                        city was spared was that there might be a place for the tillers of the soil
                        to live in. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A motley throng of peasants,
                        freedmen, small tradesmen and artisans were told off to occupy the place;
                        the whole of the territory with the buildings on it became the property of
                        the Roman State. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> It was settled that Capua
                        itself should be simply a lodgment and a shelter, a city merely in name;
                        there was to be no corporate life, no senate, no council of the plebs, no
                        magistrates; the population were without any right of public assembly or
                        self-government; they had no common interest and were incapable of taking
                        any common action. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The administration of
                        justice was in the hands of a praetor who was to be sent annually from Rome.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> In this way matters were arranged at
                        Capua in pursuance of a policy which commends itself from every point of
                        view. Sternly and swiftly was punishment meted out to those who had been
                        most guilty, the civic population was scattered far and wide with no hope of
                        return, the unoffending walls and houses were spared from the ravages of
                        fire and demolition. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The preservation of
                        the city, whilst it was a material advantage to Rome, afforded to the
                        friendly communities a striking proof of her lenity; the whole of Campania
                        and all the surrounding nationalities would have been horror-struck at the
                        destruction of such a famous and wealthy city. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> The enemy, on the other hand, was made to realise the
                        power of Rome to punish those who were faithless to her, and the
                        powerlessness of Hannibal to protect those who had gone over to him. </p>

                        anxiety about Capua, it was able to turn its attention to Spain. A force of
                        6000 infantry and 300 cavalry was placed at Nero's disposal, and he selected
                        it from the two legions he had had with him at Capua; an equal number of
                        infantry and 600 cavalry were to be furnished by the allies. <milestone

                        Tarraco. Here he hauled his ships ashore and furnished the crews with arms,
                        thus augmenting his strength. With this composite force he marched to the
                        Ebro and took over the army there from Ti. Fonteius and L. Marcius.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He then advanced against the enemy.
                        Hasdrubal-Hamilcar's son-was encamped at the Lapides Atri (the "Black
                        Boulders"). This is a place in the Auretanian country between the towns of
                        Iliturgis and Mentissa. Nero occupied the two exits of the pass. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> Hasdrubal, finding himself shut in, sent a herald
                        to promise in his name that he would deport the whole of his army from Spain
                        if he were allowed to leave his position. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        The Roman general was glad to accept the offer, and Hasdrubal asked for an
                        interview the following day. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> At this
                        conference they were to draw up in writing the terms upon which the various
                        citadels were to be handed over, and the date at which the garrisons were to
                        be withdrawn, on the understanding that they should take with them all their
                        goods and chattels. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> His request was granted, and Hasdrubal
                        ordered the most heavily armed portion of his army to get out of the pass as
                        best they could as soon as darkness set in. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /> He was careful to see that not very many went out that night, as a small
                        body would make but little noise and be more likely to escape observation.
                        They would also find their way more easily through the narrow and difficult
                        foot-paths. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The next day he kept the
                        appointment, but so much time was taken up in discussing and writing down a
                        number of things which had nothing to do with the matters they had agreed to
                        discuss, that the whole day was lost and the business adjourned till the
                        morrow. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> So another opportunity was
                        afforded him of sending off a fresh body of troops by night. <milestone

                        next day, and so it went on; several days were occupied in discussing terms,
                        and the nights in despatching the Carthaginians secretly from their camp.
                        When the greater part of the army had escaped, Hasdrubal no longer kept to
                        the conditions which he had himself proposed, and there was less and less
                        desire to come to terms as his sincerity diminished with his fears.

                        had now got out of the defile when, at daybreak, a dense fog covered the
                        valley and the whole of the surrounding country. No sooner did Hasdrubal
                        become aware of this than he sent a message to Nero begging that the
                        interview might be put off for that day as it was a day on which the
                        Carthaginians were forbidden by their religion to transact any important
                        business. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Even this did not arouse any
                        suspicion of trickery. On learning that he would be excused for that day,
                        Hasdrubal promptly left his camp with the cavalry and elephants, and by
                        keeping his movements secret, emerged into safety. <milestone n="14"

                        hurriedly prepared to follow him and force him to an engagement. <milestone

                        so impetuously now filled them with anxiety, Scipio called the voters

                            unit="section"/> He spoke in such lofty and glowing words that he evoked
                        their enthusiasm once more, and inspired them with more hopeful confidence
                        than is usually called out by faith in men's promises or by reasonable

                        developed from early youth. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In his public
                        life he generally spoke and acted as though he were guided either by visions
                        of the night or by some divine inspiration, whether it was that he was
                        really open to superstitious influences or that he claimed oracular sanction

                        minds from the beginning, from the day when he assumed the toga virilis, for
                        he never undertook any important business, either public or private, without
                        first going to the Capitol, where he sat for some time in the temple in

                        disappeared. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The belief in these marvels
                        was never scoffed at by him; on the contrary, it was strengthened by
                        deliberate policy on his part in refusing to deny or to admit that anything
                        of the kind ever occurred. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There were many

                    <p> It was the confidence with which he had in this way inspired his

                        Soon afterwards Silanus succeeded Nero and the new troops were sent into

                        completing the preparations for the next campaign Scipio returned to

                        among the enemy as among his own countrymen; there was amongst the former a

                        above the forest of Castulo, Hasdrubal, the son of Hamilcar, near the Ebro
                        in the neighbourhood of Saguntum. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This

                        fleet was sent from Sicily to Tarentum to intercept supplies from the Roman
                        garrison in the citadel. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It certainly
                        succeeded in blocking all access to the citadel from the sea, but the longer
                        it remained the greater was the scarcity amongst the townspeople as compared
                        with that amongst the Romans in the citadel. <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                        /> For though the coast was clear and open access was secured to the harbour
                        by the Carthaginian fleet, it was impossible to convey to the population of
                        the city as much corn as was consumed by the crowd of sailors, drawn from
                        every class, on board the fleet. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The
                        garrison in the citadel, on the other hand, being only a small body, were
                        able to exist on what they had previously laid in, without any external
                        supply. At length the ships were sent away, and their departure was hailed

                        Against this it was alleged that as the senate had ordered him to hand over

                        upon a middle course, he was to be allowed an ovation. The tribunes of the

                        the Syracusan and Moericus the Spaniard who marched in front wearing golden
                        crowns. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The former had guided the
                        nocturnal entry into Syracuse, the latter had been the agent in the
                        surrender of Nasos and its garrison. Each of these men received the full
                        Roman citizenship and 500 jugera of land. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        Sosis was to take his allotment in that part of the Syracusan territory
                        which had belonged to the king or to those who had taken up arms against
                        Rome, and he was allowed to choose any house in Syracuse which had been the
                        property of those who had been put to death under the laws of war.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> A further order was made that
                        Moericus and the Spaniards should have assigned to them a city and lands in
                        Sicily out of the possessions of those who had revolted from Rome.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> M. Cornelius was commissioned to
                        select the city and territory for them, where he thought best, and 400
                        jugera in the same district were also decreed as a gift to Belligenes
                        through whose instrumentality Moericus had been induced to change sides.
                        After Marcellus' departure from Sicily a Carthaginian fleet landed a force
                        of 8000 infantry and 3000 Numidian horse. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                        The cities of Murgentia and Ergetium revolted to them, and their example was
                        followed by Hybla and Macella and some other less important places.
                            <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Muttines and his Numidians were also
                        roaming all through the island and laying waste the fields of Rome's allies
                        with fire. To add to these troubles the Roman army bitterly resented not
                        being withdrawn from the province with their commander and also not being
                        allowed to winter in the towns. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                        Consequently they were very remiss in their military duties; in fact it was
                        only the absence of a leader that prevented them from breaking out into open
                        mutiny. In spite of these difficulties the praetor M. Cornelius succeeded by
                        remonstrances and reassurances in calming the temper of his men, and then
                        reduced all the revolted cities to submission. In pursuance of the senate's
                        orders he selected Murgentia, one of those cities, for the settlement of
                        Moericus and his Spaniards. </p>

                        murmurs of admiration which they heard all around them, begged the consul to
                        call up the Veturian century of seniors, as they wished to consult their
                        elders and be guided by their advice in the choice of consuls. <milestone

                        lay between three men, two of them already full of honours-Q. Fabius and M.
                        Marcellus-and, if they particularly wished a new man to be appointed consul
                        to act against the Carthaginians, M. Valerius Laevinus, who had conducted
                        operations against Philip both by sea and land with conspicuous success. So
                        they discussed the claims of these three, and after the seniors had
                        withdrawn the juniors proceeded to vote. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        They gave their vote in favour of M. Marcellus Claudius, resplendent with
                        the glory of his conquest of Sicily, and, as the second consul, M. Valerius.
                        Neither of them had put in a personal appearance. The other centuries all
                        followed the leading century. People nowadays may laugh at the admirers of

                        a thing hardly credible in these days, when we see in what contempt children

                        and gates were reported to have been struck. In the forum of Subertum
                        streams of blood had flowed for a whole day. At Eretium there was a shower
                        of stones and at Reate a mule had produced offspring. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> These portents were expiated by sacrifices of
                        full-grown victims; a day was appointed for special intercessions and the

                        the Keepers of the Sacred Books, was succeeded by M. Aemilius Lepidus. C.
                        Livius was appointed pontiff in the room of M. Pomponius Matho, and M.

                        of Rome in Sicily and Italy, and then proceeded: "It is the practice of the

                        only evacuate those cities which they have wrested from you, but will have
                        enough to do to defend Macedonia itself. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        The Acarnanians, too, whose secession from your league you feel so keenly, I

                        and promises of the Roman commander were supported by Scopas, the chief
                        magistrate of Aetolia at the time, and by Dorimachus, a leading man amongst
                        them, both of whom from their official position spoke with authority. They
                        were less reserved, and adopted a more confident tone as they extolled the

                        most, however, with the Assembly was the hope of becoming masters of

                        friends and allies of Rome were reduced to writing and an additional clause
                        was inserted that if it was their will and pleasure the Eleans and
                        Lacedaemonians as well as Attalus, Pleuratus and Scerdilaedus might be
                        included in the treaty. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Attalus was king

                        Philip on land, and the Roman general would assist them with not less than
                        twenty-five quinqueremes. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The

                        Aetolians make peace with Philip, one of the conditions was to be that he
                        would abstain from hostilities against Rome and her allies and dependencies.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Similarly, if the Romans made a

                            unit="section"/> These were the agreed conditions, and after a lapse of
                        two years, copies of the treaty were deposited by the Aetolians at Olympia,
                        and by the Romans in the Capitol, in order that the sacred memorials round

                            unit="section"/> The reason for this delay was that the Aetolian envoys
                        had been detained for a considerable time in Rome. No time, however, was
                        lost in commencing hostilities, and Laevinus attacked Zacynthus. This is a
                        small island adjacent to Aetolia, and it contains one city of the same name
                        as the island; this city, with the exception of its citadel, Laevinus
                        captured. He also took two cities belonging to the Acarnanians-Oeniadae and
                        Nasos-and handed them over to the Aetolians. <milestone n="16"

                        adjacent to his western frontier quiet he made a sudden invasion into the
                        territories of Oricum and Apollonia. The men of Apollonia came out to give

                        making incursions into Macedonia whenever they found the king occupied with
                        some distant war and his kingdom unprotected. To break their aggressiveness
                        he devastated their country, and attacked Iamphoryna, their chief city and

                        mood, they fixed their camp on the extreme limit of their borders and
                        awaited the enemy. Messengers were despatched to Philip to announce their
                        critical situation, and in spite of his recapture of Iamphoryna and other
                        successes in Thrace he was compelled to abandon his northern campaign and go

                        beyond Dium, and on learning that the Aetolians had retired he returned to

                        Naupactus. He announced that he was going on to attack Anticyra, so that
                        Scopas and the Aetolians might be ready for him there. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> Anticyra is situated in Locris, on the left hand as you
                        enter the Corinthian Gulf, and is only a short distance either by sea or

                        attack began in both directions; the naval attack was the heavier one
                        because the ships were furnished with artillery and engines of every kind,
                        and it was the Romans who were delivering the attack on this side. In a few
                        days the place surrendered and was made over to the Aetolians; the booty in
                        accordance with the treaty became the property of the Romans. During the
                        siege a despatch was handed to Laevinus informing him that he had been made
                        consul, and that P. Sulpicius was coming to succeed him. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Whilst he was there he was overtaken by a tedious
                        illness, and consequently arrived in Rome much later than was expected.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> M. Marcellus entered upon his
                        consulship on March 15, and in order to comply with traditional usage
                        summoned a meeting of the senate on the same day. The meeting was a purely
                        formal one; he announced that in his colleague's absence he should not
                        submit any proposals either in respect of the policy of the State or the
                        assignment of provinces. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> "I am quite
                        aware," he told the senators, "that there are a large body of Sicilians
                        quartered in the country houses of my detractors round the City. I have no
                        intention of preventing them from publishing here in Rome the charges which

                        complaints against me. He has filled the City with letters containing false
                        information about a state of war existing in Sicily, solely that he may

                        speech won for him the reputation of being a man of moderation and
                        self-control. The senate adjourned, and it seemed as though there would be a
                        total suspension of business pending the other consul's arrival. As usual,
                        idleness led to discontent and grumbling. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>

                        moved, the exhaustion of Italy by the constant levies, the almost annual

                        ambitious, quite capable, even in a time of peace and quiet, of getting up a
                        war, and now that war was actually going on all the less likely to allow the
                        citizens any respite or breathing space. </p>

                        Soon after, private buildings-the Basilicae did not yet exist-the Lautumiae,

                        The fire raged all through the next day and there was not the smallest doubt
                        that it was the work of incendiaries, for fires started simultaneously in
                        several different places. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The senate
                        accordingly authorised the consul to give public notice that whoever

                        nobles, whose fathers had been beheaded by Q. Fulvius, had caused the fire
                        and were prepared to commit every description of crime if they were not

                        master, the day before he gave information, he had run away and had made out
                        of an occurrence which was really accidental the foundation of a false

                    <p> When Laevinus was passing Capua on his way to Rome he was surrounded by a
                        crowd of the inhabitants who implored him with tears to allow them to go to
                        Rome and try if they could not awaken the compassion of the senate and
                        persuade them not to allow Q. Flaccus to ruin them utterly and efface their

                        had decreed to be the pledge and guarantee of Roman dominion. He considered
                        that it would be anything but safe to give the Capuans a chance of entering
                        the City. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> After hearing this Laevinus
                        made the Capuans take an oath to Flaccus that they would return within five

                        the unrest amongst the Aetolians, the Acarnanians and the Locrians. He also
                        gave details as to his own military and naval movements, and stated that he

                        senate made the following dispositions. One consul was to operate in Italy

                        allies was reduced, one strong legion being formed out of the two; this
                        consisted of 5000 infantry and 300 cavalry, those who had served longest
                        being sent home. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The army of the allies

                        as to the release of the veterans who had seen the longest service. In the
                        case of the retiring consul, Cn. Fulvius, no change was made; he retained
                        his army and his province, Apulia, for another year. His late colleague, P.
                        Sulpicius, received orders to disband his entire army with the exception of
                        the naval force. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Similarly the army which
                        M. Cornelius had commanded was to be sent home from Sicily. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> The men of Cannae, who practically represented
                        two legions, were still to remain in the island, under the command of the
                        praetor L. Cincius. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> L. Cornelius had
                        commanded the same number of legions the previous year in Sardinia, and
                        these were now transferred to the praetor P. Manlius Vulso. <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> The consuls received instructions to see that in
                        raising the City legions, none were enrolled who had been in the army of M.
                        Valerius, or in that of Q. Fulvius. So the total number of Roman legions in
                        active service that year was not to exceed one-and-twenty. </p>

                        appointments, the consuls were ordered to ballot for their commands. Sicily
                        and the fleet fell to Marcellus, Italy and the campaign against Hannibal to
                        Laevinus. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This result utterly appalled the
                        Sicilians, to whom it seemed as though all the horrors of the capture of
                        Syracuse were to be repeated. They were standing in full view of the
                        consuls, waiting anxiously for the result of the balloting, and when they
                        saw how it was decided, they broke out into loud laments and cries of
                        distress, which drew the eyes of all upon them for the moment, and became
                        the subject of much comment afterwards. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        Clothing themselves in mourning garb they visited the houses of the senators
                        and assured each of them in turn that if Marcellus went back to Sicily with
                        the power and authority of a consul they would every one of them abandon his
                        city and quit the island for ever. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He had,
                        they said, before shown himself vindictive and implacable towards them; what
                        would he do now, furious as he was at the Sicilians who had come to Rome to
                        complain of him? It would be better for the island to be buried beneath the
                        fires of Aetna or plunged in the depths of the sea than to be given up to
                        such an enemy to wreak his rage and vengeance on it. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> These remonstrances of the Sicilians were made to
                        individual nobles in their own homes, and gave rise to lively discussions,
                        in which sympathy with the sufferers and hostile sentiments towards
                        Marcellus were freely expressed. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> At last
                        they reached the senate. The consuls were requested to consult that body as

                            unit="section"/> In addressing the House Marcellus said that had the

                        different line, but as matters stood, he did not wish it to be open to any
                        one to say that they were afraid to lay their complaints against the man in
                        whose power they would shortly be placed. If, therefore, it made no
                        difference to his colleague he was prepared to exchange provinces with him.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He begged the senate not to make any
                        order, for since it would have been unfair to him for his colleague to have
                        chosen his province without recourse to the ballot, how much more unfair and
                        even humiliating to him would it be now to have the province which had

                        exchange provinces. Marcellus was being hurried on by his destiny to meet
                        Hannibal, in order that, as he was the first Roman general to win <milestone

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When the exchange of provinces had been
                        decided, the Sicilians were introduced into the senate. After expatiating at
                        some length upon the unbroken loyalty of Hiero to Rome, and claiming the
                        credit of it for the people rather than for the king, they proceeded: "There
                        were many reasons for the hatred we felt towards Hieronymus and afterwards
                        towards Hippocrates and Epicydes, but the principal one was their abandoning
                        Rome for Hannibal. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> It was this that led
                        some of the foremost of our younger men to assassinate Hieronymus close to
                        the senate-house, and also induced some seventy who belonged to our noblest
                        houses to form a plot for the destruction of Epicydes and Hippocrates.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> As Marcellus failed to support them by
                        bringing up his army to Syracuse at the time he promised, the plot was
                        disclosed by an informer, and they were all put to death by the tyrants.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Marcellus was really responsible for
                        the tyranny, owing to his ruthless sacking of Leontium. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> From that time the Syracusan leaders never ceased to go
                        over to Marcellus and undertake to deliver up the city to him whenever he
                        wished. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He would rather have taken it by
                        storm, but when all his attempts by sea and land failed, and he saw that the
                        thing was impossible, he chose as agents of the surrender an artisan called
                        Sosis and the Spaniard Moericus, rather than let the leaders of the city,
                        who had so often offered in vain to do so, undertake the task. No doubt he
                        considered that he would thus have more justification for plundering and
                        massacring the friends of Rome. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Even if
                        the revolt to Hannibal had been the act of senate and people and not simply
                        of Hieronymus; if it had been the government of Syracuse who closed the
                        gates against Marcellus, and not the tyrants Hippocrates and Epicydes who
                        had ousted the government; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> if we had
                        warred against Rome in the spirit and temper of the Carthaginians, what
                        greater severity could Marcellus have shown towards us than that which he
                        actually practiced, unless he had blotted Syracuse out from the face of the
                        earth? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At all events, nothing has been
                        left to us beyond our walls and our houses stripped of everything, and the
                        defaced and despoiled temples of our gods, from which even the gods
                        themselves and their votive offerings have been carried off. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> Many have been deprived of their land, so that
                        they have not even the bare soil on which to support themselves, and all who
                        belong to them, with the remains of their wrecked fortunes. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> We beg and entreat you, senators, if you cannot
                        order all that we have lost to be restored to us, at least to insist upon
                        the restitution of what can be found and identified." After they had stated
                        their grievances, Laevinus ordered them to withdraw, that their position
                        might be discussed. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> "Let them stop,"
                        exclaimed Marcellus, "that I may make my reply in their presence, since we
                        who conduct war on your behalf, senators, must do so on condition of those
                        whom we have vanquished coming forward as our accusers. Two cities have been
                        taken this year: let Capua call Fabius to account, and Syracuse, Marcellus."

                        senate-house, Marcellus made the following speech: "I have not so far
                        forgotten, senators, the majesty of Rome or the dignity of my office as to
                        stoop to defend myself, as consul, against the charges of these Greeks, if
                        they concerned me alone. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The question is
                        not so much what I have done as what they ought to have suffered. Had they
                        not been enemies it is a matter of indifference whether I maltreated
                        Syracuse now or in Hiero's lifetime. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But
                        if they have proved false to us, opened their gates to the enemy, threatened
                        our envoys with drawn swords, shut their city and walls against us and
                        called in a Carthaginian army to protect them against us, who is there who
                        can feel any indignation at their having suffered hostile violence after
                        having practiced it? I declined the offers of their leaders to deliver up
                        the city, and looked upon Sosis and the Spaniard Moericus as much more
                        suitable persons to be trusted in a matter of such importance. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> As you make their humble station in life a
                        reproach to others, you do not yourselves belong to the lowest class in
                        Syracuse, and yet who amongst you promised to open your gates and admit my
                        armed force into your city? <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Those who did
                        this are the objects of your hatred and execration; not even in this place
                        do you shrink from insulting them, showing thereby how far you yourselves
                        were from contemplating anything of the kind. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> That low social position, senators, which these men
                        make a ground of reproach, proves most clearly that I discouraged no man who
                        was willing to render effectual help to the commonwealth. Before commencing
                        the siege of Syracuse, I made various attempts at a peaceful settlement,
                        first by sending envoys and then by personal interviews with the leaders.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> It was only when I found that no
                        reverence for the persons of my envoys protected them from violence and that
                        I was unable to get any reply from the leaders with whom I conferred at
                        their gates, that I took action and finally took the city by storm, after a
                        vast expenditure of toil and exertion by sea and land. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> As to the incidents attending its capture, these men
                        would be more justified in laying their complaints before Hannibal and his
                        vanquished Carthaginians than before the senate of the people who vanquished
                        them. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> If, senators, I had intended to
                        conceal my spoliation of Syracuse I should never have adorned the City of
                        Rome with its spoils. With regard to what I, as conqueror, took away or
                        bestowed in individual cases, I am quite satisfied that I acted in
                        accordance with the laws of war, according to the deserts of each
                        individual. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Whether you approve of my
                        action or not is a question that concerns the State more than it concerns
                        me. I only did my duty, but it will be a serious matter for the republic, if
                        by rescinding my acts you make other generals in the future more remiss in
                        doing their duty. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> And since you have
                        heard what both the Sicilians and I have had to say in each other's
                        presence, we will leave the House together in order that the senate may be
                        able to discuss the matter more freely in my absence." The Sicilians were
                        accordingly dismissed; Marcellus proceeded to the Capitol to enrol troops.

                        Sicilians. There was a long debate and great divergence of opinion.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Many of those present supported the
                        view expressed by T. Manlius Torquatus. They were of opinion that
                        hostilities ought to have been directed against the tyrants, who were the
                        common enemies of Syracuse and of Rome. The city ought to have been allowed
                        to surrender, not taken by storm, and when surrendered it ought to have had
                        its own laws and liberties guaranteed to it, instead of being ruined by war
                        after it had been worn out by a deplorable servitude under its tyrants.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The struggle between the tyrants and
                        the Roman general in which Syracuse was the prize of victory had resulted in
                        the utter destruction of a most famous and beautiful city, the granary and
                        treasury of the Roman people. The commonwealth had frequently experienced
                        its generosity, especially in the present Punic war, and the City had been
                        embellished by its munificent gifts. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> If
                        Hiero, that loyal supporter of the power of Rome, could rise from the dead,
                        with what face would any one dare to show him either Rome or Syracuse? In
                        the one-his own city-he would see universal spoliation and a large part of
                        it burnt, and as he approached the other he would see just outside its
                        walls, almost within its gates, the spoils of his country. This was the line
                        of argument urged by those who sought to create a feeling against the consul
                        and evoke sympathy for the Sicilians. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The

                        unfavourable view of his conduct, and a decree was passed confirming the
                        acts of Marcellus both during the war and after his victory, and declaring
                        that the senate would for the future make the interests of the Syracusans
                        their charge and would instruct Laevinus to safeguard the property of the
                        citizens so far as he could without inflicting any loss on the State.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Two senators were sent to the Capitol
                        to request the consul to come back, and after the Sicilians had again been

                        gain sympathy and relief in their distress. They also begged him to take
                        them and their city under his protection, and look upon them as his clients.
                        The consul promised that he would do so, and after a few gracious words
                        dismissed them. </p>

                        audience. Their case was a harder one, and their appeal for mercy was all
                        the stronger. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They could not deny that
                        they deserved punishment, and there were no tyrants on whom they could throw
                        the blame, but they considered that they had paid an adequate penalty after
                        so many of their senators had been carried off by poison, and so many had
                        died under the axe. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Some of their nobles,
                        they said, were still living, who had not been driven by the consciousness
                        of guilt into doing away with themselves, nor had the victor in his wrath
                        condemned them to death. These men begged that they and their families might
                        be set at liberty, and some portion of their goods restored to them.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They were for the most part Roman
                        citizens, connected with Roman families by intermarriage. After the envoys
                        had withdrawn, there was some doubt as to whether they ought to summon Q.
                        Fulvius from Capua-the consul Claudius had died soon after its capture-in
                        order that the matter might be debated in the presence of the general whose
                        proceedings were being called in question. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        This had just been done in the case of Marcellus and the Sicilians. When,
                        however, some senators were seen sitting in the House who had been through
                        the whole of the siege-M. Atilius Regulus and Caius the brother of Flaccus,
                        both on his staff, and Q. Minucius and L. Veturius Philo, who had been
                        members of Claudius' staff-they would not have Q. Fulvius recalled, nor the
                        hearing of the Capuans adjourned. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Amongst
                        those who had been at Capua, the man whose opinion carried most weight was
                        M. Atilius, and he was asked what course he would advise. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> He replied: "I believe I was present at the military
                        council which met after the fall of Capua, when the consuls made enquiry as
                        to which of the Capuans had assisted our republic. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> They discovered only two, and those were women. One was
                        Vestia Oppia of Atella, who was living in Capua and who offered sacrifices
                        daily for the welfare and triumph of Rome; the other was Cluvia Pacula, at
                        one time a woman of loose character, who secretly supplied the starving
                        prisoners with food. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The rest of the
                        Capuans were just as hostile to us as the Carthaginians themselves, and
                        those whom Q. Fulvius executed were selected rather on account of their
                        higher rank than of their greater guilt. I do not quite see how the senate
                        is competent to deal with the Capuans, who are Roman citizens, without an
                        order of the people. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> After the revolt of
                        the Satricans, the course adopted by our ancestors was for a tribune of the
                        plebs, M. Antistius, to bring the matter first before the Assembly, and a
                        resolution was passed empowering the senate to decide what should be done to
                        them. I therefore advise that we arrange with the tribunes of the plebs for
                        one or more of them to propose a resolution to that body empowering us to
                        settle the fate o f the Capuans." <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> L.
                        Atilius, tribune of the plebs, was authorised by the senate to put the

                        the inhabitants of Capua, Atella and Calatia, and also the dwellers in the

                        at the arbitrament and disposal of the people of Rome, and whereas they have
                        surrendered divers persons together with <milestone n="13??" unit="section"

                        pleasure shall be done in regard of all these persons and things?"
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The resolution of the Assembly ran
                        thus: "What the senate, or the greater part of those who are present, shall,
                        on oath, decree and determine, that we will and order shall be done." </p>

                        made the following orders: First they restored their liberty and property to
                        Oppia and Cluvia; if they wished to ask the senate for a further reward,
                        they were to come to Rome. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Separate
                        decrees were made in the case of each of the Capuan families; it is not
                        worth while giving a complete enumeration. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        Some were to have their property confiscated, they themselves with their
                        wives and children were to be sold, with the exception of those of their
                        daughters who had married outside the territory before they passed under the
                        power of Rome. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Others were to be thrown
                        into chains, and their fate settled afterwards. In the case of the rest, the
                        question whether their property should be confiscated or not depended upon
                        the amount at which they were assessed. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Where property was restored it was to include all the captured live stock
                        except the horses, all the slaves except the adult males, and everything
                        which was not attached to the soil. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was
                        further decreed that the populations of Capua, Atella, Calatia and the
                        valley of the Sabatus should all retain their <milestone n="7??"

                        had been with the enemy, but none of them could become a Roman citizen or a
                        member of the Latin League. None of those who had been in Capua during the
                        siege could remain in the city or its neighbourhood beyond a certain date; a
                        place of residence was assigned to them beyond the Tiber at some distance
                        from it. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Those who had not been in Capua
                        during the war, nor in any revolted Campanian city, were to be settled to

                        Hannibal came to Capua were to be removed to this side of the Volturnus, and
                        no one was to possess any land or building within fifteen miles of the sea.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Those who had been deported beyond
                        the Tiber were forbidden to acquire or to hold either for themselves or
                        their posterity landed property anywhere except in the territories of Veii,
                        Sutrium and Nepete, and in no case was such holding to exceed fifty jugera.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The property of all the senators and
                        of all who had held any magistracy in Capua, Atella and Calatia was ordered
                        to be sold in Capua, and those persons whom it had been decided to sell into
                        slavery were sent to Rome and sold there. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                        The disposal of the images and bronze statues which were alleged to have

                            unit="section"/> After hearing these decrees. the Capuans were dismissed
                        in a much more sorrowful state of mind than that in which they had come. It
                        was no longer Q. Fulvius' cruelty to them, but the injustice of the gods and
                        their accursed fate that they denounced. </p>

                        with its proper complement of rowers. There was not a sufficient number of
                        men available, nor was there any money at the time in the treasury with
                        which to procure them or to pay them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In
                        view of this state of things the consuls issued an order requiring private
                        individuals to furnish seamen in proportion to their income and their rank,
                        as they had done on a previous occasion, and also to supply them with thirty
                        days' provision and pay. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This order
                        excited such a widespread feeling of indignation and resentment that if the
                        people had had a leader they would have risen in insurrection. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> The consuls, they said, after ruining the
                        Sicilians and Capuans, had seized upon the Roman plebs as their next victim
                        to mangle and destroy. "After being drained by the war-tax," they
                        complained, "for so many years, we have nothing left but the bare and wasted
                        soil. Our houses have been burnt by the enemy, our slaves who tilled our
                        fields have been appropriated by the State, first buying them for a few
                        coppers to make soldiers of them, and now requisitioning them for seamen.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Whatever silver or gold we had has
                        been taken to pay the rowers and furnish the annual war-tax. No resort to

                        possess. Let the consuls sell our goods, then let them glut their rage on
                        our bodies which are all we have left; nothing remains with which we can
                        even ransom ourselves." <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Language of this
                        kind was used not only in private conversation, but openly in the Forum,
                        before the very eyes of the consuls. A vast crowd had gathered round the
                        tribunal, uttering angry cries, and the consuls were powerless to allay the
                        agitation either by fair speeches or by threats. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Ultimately they announced that they would give them
                        three days to think the matter over, and they themselves devoted that time
                        to seeing whether they could not find some way out of the difficulty.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The next day they called the senate
                        together to consider the matter, and many arguments were advanced to prove
                        that the plebs were acting fairly and reasonably in their protest. At last
                        the discussion came round to this point, that whether fair or unfair the

                        compulsion by the magistrates, the full complement of rowers was made up,
                        and the State put in a position to pay them. As the preparations for war
                        were now complete the consuls started for their respective provinces. </p>

                        feelings of sorrow and joy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In Italy the
                        loss of Tarentum was felt to be a grievous blow, but the unexpected stand by

                        for Rome, but in the new alliance with the Aetolians and Attalus, king of
                        Pergamum, it seemed as though Fortune were giving a pledge of Rome's
                        dominion in the East. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians,
                        again, felt that the capture of Tarentum was a set-off against the loss of
                        Capua, and though they prided themselves on having marched unopposed up to
                        the walls of Rome they were mortified at the futility of their enterprise,
                        and humiliated by <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> the contempt shown for

                        in Spain itself, where the destruction of two great generals with their
                        armies had raised their hopes of finally expelling the Romans and finishing
                        the war, the higher their hopes had been, the greater the disgust they felt
                        at their victory being robbed of all its importance by L. Marcius, who was

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Hannibal's principal cause of anxiety was
                        the effect produced by the fall of Capua. It was generally felt that the
                        Romans had shown greater determination in attacking than he had in defending
                        the place, and this alienated many of the Italian communities from him.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He could not occupy them all with
                        garrisons unless he was prepared to weaken his army by detaching numerous
                        small units from it; a course at that time highly inexpedient. <milestone
                            n="3" unit="section"/> On the other hand he did not dare to withdraw any
                        of his garrisons and so leave the loyalty of his allies to depend upon their
                        hopes and fears. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> His temperament, prone as
                        it was to rapacity and cruelty, led him to plunder the places which he was
                        unable to defend, in order that they might be left to the enemy waste and
                        barren. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This evil policy had evil results
                        for him, for it aroused horror and loathing not only amongst the actual
                        sufferers but amongst all who heard of them. The Roman consul was not slow
                        in sounding the feelings of those cities where any hope of recovering them
                        had shown itself. Amongst these was the city of Salapia. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> Two of its most prominent citizens were Dasius and
                        Blattius. Dasius was friendly to Hannibal; Blattius favoured the interests
                        of Rome as far as he safely could, and had sent secret messages to Marcellus
                        holding out hopes that the city might be surrendered. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> But the thing could not be carried through without the
                        help of Dasius. For a long time he hesitated, but at last he addressed
                        himself to Dasius, not so much in the hope of success as because no better
                        plan presented itself. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Dasius was opposed
                        to the project, and by way of injuring his political rival disclosed the
                        affair to Hannibal. Hannibal summoned them both before his tribunal.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When they appeared, he was occupied
                        with business, intending to go into their case as soon as he was at liberty,
                        and the two men, accuser and accused, stood waiting, apart from the crowd.
                        Whilst thus waiting Blattius approached Dasius on the subject of the
                        surrender. At this open and barefaced conduct, Dasius called out that the
                        surrender of the city was being mooted under the very eyes of Hannibal.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Hannibal and those round him felt
                        that the very audacity of the thing made the charge improbable, and regarded
                        it as due to spite and jealousy, since it was easy to invent such an
                        accusation in the absence of witnesses. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        They were accordingly dismissed. Blattius, however, did not desist from his
                        venturesome project. He was perpetually urging the matter and showing what a
                        beneficial thing it would be for them both and for their city. <milestone
                            n="12" unit="section"/> At last he succeeded in effecting the surrender
                        of the city with its garrison of 5000 Numidians. But the surrender could
                        only be effected with a heavy loss of life. The garrison were by far the
                        finest cavalry in the Carthaginian army, and although they were taken by
                        surprise and could make no use of their horses in the city, they seized
                        their arms in the confusion and attempted to cut their way out. <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> When they found escape impossible they fought to
                        the last man. Not more than fifty fell into the hands of the enemy alive.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The loss of this troop of horse was a
                        heavier blow to Hannibal than the loss of Salapia; never from that time was
                        the Carthaginian superior in cavalry, hitherto by far his most efficient
                        arm. </p>

                        Roman garrison in the citadel of Tarentum had become almost insupportable;
                        the men and their commandant M. Livius placed all their hopes in the arrival
                        of supplies sent from Sicily. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> To secure a
                        safe passage for these along the coast of Italy, a squadron of about twenty
                        vessels was stationed at Regium. The fleet and the transports were under the
                        command of D. Quinctius. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He was a man of
                        humble birth, but his many deeds of gallantry had gained him a high military
                        reputation. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He had only five ships to
                        begin with, the largest of these-two triremes-had been assigned to him by
                        Marcellus; subsequently, owing to the effective use he made of these, three
                        quinqueremes were <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> added to his command,
                        and at last, by compelling the allied cities, Regium, Velliea and Paestum to
                        furnish the ships which they were bound by treaty to supply, he made up the
                        above-mentioned squadron of twenty vessels. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                        /> As this fleet was setting out from Regium, and was opposite Sapriportis,
                        a place about fifteen miles from Tarentum, it fell in with a Tarentine
                        fleet, also of twenty ships, under the command of Democrates. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> The Roman commander, not anticipating a fight,
                        had all sail set; he had, however, got together his full complement of
                        rowers while he was in the neighbourhood of Croton and Sybaris, and his
                        fleet was excellently equipped and manned, considering the size of the
                        vessels. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It so happened that the wind
                        completely died down just as the enemy came into sight, and there was ample
                        time to lower the sails and get the rowers and soldiers into readiness for
                        the approaching conflict. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Seldom have two
                        regular fleets gone into action with such determination as these small
                        flotillas, for they were fighting for larger issues than their own success.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Tarentines hoped that as they had
                        already recovered their city from the Romans after the lapse of nearly a
                        century, so they might now rescue their citadel, by cutting off the enemy's
                        supplies after they had deprived them of the mastery of the sea. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> The Romans were eager to show, by retaining
                        their hold on the citadel, that Tarentum had not been lost in fair fight.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> but by a foul and treacherous stroke.
                        So, when the signal was given on each side, they rowed with their prows
                        straight at each other; there was no backing or maneuvering, nor did they
                        let go of any ship when once they had grappled and boarded. They fought at
                        such close quarters that they not only discharged missiles, but even used
                        their swords in hand-to-hand fighting. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                        The prows were locked together and remained so while the hinder part of the
                        vessel was pushed about by the oars of hostile ships. The vessels were so
                        crowded together that hardly any missile failed to reach its aim or fell
                        into the water. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> They pressed forward
                        front to front like a line of infantry, and the combatants made their way
                        from ship to ship. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Conspicuous amongst
                        all was the fight between the two ships which had led their respective lines
                        and were the first to engage. </p>
                    <p> Quinctius himself was in the Roman ship, and in the Tarentine vessel was a
                        man named Nico Perco, who hated the Romans for private as well as public
                        grounds, and who was equally hated by them, for he was one of the party who
                        betrayed Tarentum to Hannibal. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Whilst
                        Quinctius was fighting and encouraging his men, Nico took him unawares and
                        ran him through with his spear. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> He fell
                        headlong over the prow, and the victorious Tarentine springing on to the
                        ship dislodged the enemy, who were thrown into confusion by the loss of
                        their leader. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> The foreship was now in the
                        hands of the Tarentines, and the Romans in a compact body were with
                        difficulty defending the hinder part of the vessel, when another of the
                        hostile triremes suddenly appeared astern. Between the two the Roman ship
                        was captured. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> The sight of the admiral's
                        ship in the enemy's hands created a panic, and the remainder of the fleet
                        fled in all directions; some were sunk, others were hurriedly rowed to land
                        and were seized by the people of Thurium and Metapontum. Very few of the
                        transports which were following with supplies fell into the enemy's hands;
                        the rest, shifting their sails to meet the changing winds, were carried out
                        to sea. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> An affair took place at Tarentum
                        during this time which led to a very different result. <milestone n="21"
                            unit="section"/> A foraging force of 4000 Tarentines were dispersed
                        through the fields, and Livius, the Roman commandant, who was always looking
                        out for a chance of striking a blow, sent C. Persius, an able and energetic
                        officer, with 2500 men from the citadel to attack them. <milestone n="22"
                            unit="section"/> He fell upon them while they were dispersed in
                        scattered groups all through the fields, and after inflicting great and
                        widespread slaughter, drove the few who escaped in headlong flight through
                        their half-opened gates into the town. So matters were equalised as far as
                        Tarentum was concerned; the Romans were victorious by land, and the
                        Tarentines by sea. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> Both were alike
                        disappointed in their hopes of obtaining the corn which had been within
                        their view. </p>

                        looked forward to by all the friendly cities, both those who had been old
                        allies of Rome, and those who had recently joined her. His first and most
                        important task was the settlement of the affairs of Syracuse, which, as
                        peace had only quite recently been established, were still in confusion.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> When he had accomplished this task he
                        marched to Agrigentum, where the embers of war were still smouldering, and a
                        Carthaginian garrison still in occupation. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        Fortune favoured his enterprise. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hanno was
                        in command, but the Carthaginians placed their chief reliance on Muttines
                        and his Numidians. He was scouring the island from end to end and carrying
                        off plunder from the friends of Rome; neither force nor stratagem could keep
                        him from entering Agrigentum and leaving it on his raids whenever he chose.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> His reputation as a dashing officer
                        was beginning to eclipse that of the commandant himself, and at last created
                        so much jealousy that even the successes he gained were unwelcome to Hanno,
                        because of the man who gained them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It
                        ended in his giving the command of the cavalry to his own son in the hope
                        that by depriving Muttines of his post he would also destroy his influence
                        with the Numidians. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> It had just the
                        opposite effect, for the ill-feeling created only made Muttines more
                        popular, and he showed his resentment at the injustice done to him by at
                        once entering into secret negotiations with Laevinus for the surrender of
                        the city. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When his emissaries had come to
                        an understanding with the consul and arranged the plan of operations, the
                        Numidians seized the gate leading to the sea after driving off or massacring
                        the men on guard, and admitted a Roman force which was in readiness into the
                        city. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As they were marching in serried
                        ranks into the forum and the heart of the city, amidst great confusion,
                        Hanno, thinking it was only a riotous disturbance caused by the Numidians,
                        such as had often happened before, went to allay the tumult. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> When, however, he saw in the distance a larger
                        body of troops than the Numidians amounted to, and when the well-known
                        battle shout of the Romans reached his ears, he at once took to flight
                        before a missile could reach him. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        Escaping with Epicydes through a gate on the other side of the city, and
                        attended by a small escort, he reached the shore. Here they were fortunate
                        enough to find a small ship, in which they sailed across to Africa,
                        abandoning Sicily, for which they had fought through so many years, to their
                        victorious enemy. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The mixed population of
                        Sicilians and Carthaginians whom they had left behind, made no attempt at
                        resistance, but rushed away in wild flight, and, as the exits were all
                        closed, they were slaughtered round the gates. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> When he had gained possession of the place, Laevinus
                        ordered the men who had been at the head of affairs in Agrigentum to be
                        scourged and beheaded; the rest of the population he sold with the plunder,
                        and sent all the money to Rome. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> When the fate of the Agrigentines became
                        generally known throughout Sicily, all the cities at once declared for Rome.
                        In a short time twenty towns were clandestinely surrendered and six taken by
                        storm, and as many as forty voluntarily surrendered on terms. <milestone
                            n="15" unit="section"/> The consul meted out rewards and punishments to
                        the chief men in these cities, according to each man's deserts, and now that
                        the Sicilians had at last laid arms aside he obliged them to turn their
                        attention to agriculture. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> That fertile
                        island was not only capable of supporting its own population, but had on
                        many occasions relieved the scarcity in Rome, and the consul intended that
                        it should do so again if necessary. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                        Agathyrna had become the seat of a motley population, numbering some 4000
                        men, made up of all sorts of characters-refugees, insolvent debtors-most of
                        them had committed capital offences at the time when they were living in
                        their own cities and under their own laws and afterwards when similarity of
                        fortunes arising from various causes had drawn them together at Agathyrna.
                            <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Laevinus did not think it safe to
                        leave these men behind in the island, as a material for fresh disturbances,
                        whilst things were settling down under the newly established peace. The
                        Regians too would find a body so experienced in brigandage as they were,
                        very useful; accordingly Laevinus transported them all to Italy. As far as
                        Sicily was concerned, the state of war was put an end to this year. </p>

                        completed he drew up the vessels in the harbour as though he were going to
                        blockade the place by sea. Then he was rowed round the fleet and warned the
                        captains to be careful in keeping a look-out by night, as an enemy when
                        first besieged makes counter-attacks in all directions. On his return to
                        camp he explained to his soldiers his plan of operations and his reasons for
                        beginning the campaign with an attack upon a solitary city in preference to
                        anything else. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> After they were mustered on
                        parade he made the following speech to them: "Soldiers, if any one supposes
                        that you have been brought here for the sole purpose of attacking this city,
                        he is making more account of the work before you than of the advantage you
                        will reap from it. You are going, it is true, to attack the walls of a
                        single city, but in the capture of this one city you will have secured the
                        whole of Spain. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Here are the hostages
                        taken from all the nobles and kings and tribes, and when once these are in
                        your power, everything which the Carthaginians now hold will be given up to
                        you. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Here is the enemy's war-chest,
                        without which they cannot keep up the war, seeing that they have to pay
                        their mercenaries, and the money will be of the utmost service to us in
                        gaining over the barbarians. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Here are
                        their artillery, their armoury, the whole of their engines of war, which
                        will at once provide you with all you want, and leave the enemy destitute of
                        all he needs. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And what is more, we shall
                        become masters, not only of a most wealthy and beautiful city, but also of a
                        most commodious harbour, from which all that is requisite for the purposes
                        of war, both by sea and land, will be supplied. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Great as our gains will be, the deprivations which the
                        enemy suffers will be still greater. Here is their stronghold, their
                        granary, their treasure, their arsenal-everything is stored here. Here is
                        their direct route from Africa. This is their only naval base between the
                        Pyrenees and Gades; from this Africa threatens the whole of Spain.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But I see that you are all perfectly
                        ready; let us pass over to the assault on New Carthage, with our full
                        strength and a courage that knows no fear." The men all shouted with one
                        voice, that they would carry out his orders, and he marched them up to the
                        city. Then he ordered a general attack to be made by the army and the fleet.

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When Mago, the Carthaginian commander, saw
                        that an attack was being prepared both by land and sea, he made the
                        following disposition of his forces. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Two
                        thousand townsmen were posted in the direction of the Roman camp; the
                        citadel was occupied by 500 soldiers; 500 more were stationed in the higher
                        part of the city, towards the east. The rest of the townsmen were ordered to
                        be in readiness to meet any sudden emergency and to hasten in whatever
                        direction the shouting of the enemy might summon them. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> Then the gate was thrown open and those who had been
                        drawn up in the street leading to their enemy's camp were sent forward.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Romans, at the direction of their
                        general, retired a short distance in order to be nearer to the supports
                        which were to be sent up. At first the lines stood confronting each other in
                        equal strength; but as the successive reinforcements came up they not only
                        turned the enemy to flight, but pressed upon them so closely as they fled in
                        disorder that if the "retire" had not sounded they would in all probability
                        have burst into the city pell-mell with the fugitives. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The confusion and terror of the battlefield spread
                        right through the city; many of the pickets fled from their stations
                        panic-struck; the defenders of the walls leaped down the shortest way they
                        could and deserted the fortifications. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Scipio had taken his stand on an eminence which they called Mercury's Hill,
                        and from here he became aware that the walls were in many places without
                        defenders. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He at once called out the whole
                        force in the camp to the attack, and ordered the scaling ladders to be
                        brought up. Covered by the shields of three powerful young men-for missiles
                        of every description were flying from the battlements-he went up close to
                        the <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> walls, encouraging his men, giving
                        the necessary orders, and, what did most to stimulate their efforts,
                        observing with his own eyes each man's courage or cowardice. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> So they rushed on, regardless of missiles and
                        wounds, and neither the walls nor the men upon them could prevent them from
                        striving who should be the first to mount. <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                        /> At the same time the ships commenced an attack upon that part of the city
                        which faced the sea. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Here, however, there
                        was too much noise and confusion to admit of a regular assault, for what
                        with bringing up the vessels and hauling out the scaling ladders, and
                        clambering ashore as quickly as they could, the men only got in one
                        another's way through their hurry and eagerness. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Whilst this was going on the Carthaginian
                        general had manned the walls with his regular soldiers, and they were amply
                        supplied with missiles, great heaps of which had been stored in readiness.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But neither the men, nor their
                        missiles, nor anything else proved such a sure defence as the walls
                        themselves. Very few of the ladders were long enough to reach to the top of
                        the wall, and the longer the ladders the weaker they were. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The consequence was that whilst each man who reached
                        the top was unable to get on to the wall, the others who came up behind him
                        were unable to advance and the ladder was broken by the mere weight of men.
                        Some who were on ladders which stood the strain grew dizzy from the height
                        and fell to the ground. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As men and ladders
                        were crashing down in all directions and the spirits and courage of the
                        enemy were rising with their success, the signal was sounded for retiring.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> This led the besieged to hope that
                        they would not only gain a respite from their hard and wearisome struggle
                        for the time being, but would also be safe for the future, as they believed
                        that the city could not be taken by escalade and storm, whilst the
                        construction of siege works would be a difficult matter and would allow time
                        for succours to be sent. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The noise and
                        tumult of this first attempt had hardly subsided when Scipio ordered fresh
                        troops to take the ladders from those who were exhausted and wounded and
                        make a more determined attack upon the city. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                        /> He had ascertained from the fishermen of Tarraco, who were in the habit
                        of crossing these waters in light skiffs and when these ran aground of
                        wading ashore through the shallows, that it was easy at low water to
                        approach the walls on foot. It was now reported to him that the tide was on
                        the ebb; and he at once took about 500 men with him and marched down to the
                        water. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It was about midday, and not only
                        was the falling tide drawing the water seaward, but a strong northerly wind
                        which had sprung up was driving it in the same direction, and the lagoon had
                        become so shallow that in some places it was waist-deep and in others only
                        reached to the knee. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This state of things,
                        which Scipio had ascertained by careful investigation and reasoning, he
                        ascribed to the direct intervention of the gods, who he said were turning
                        the sea into a highway for the Romans, and by withdrawing its waters were
                        opening up a path which had never before been trodden by mortal feet. He
                        bade his men follow the guidance of Neptune and make their way through the
                        middle of the lagoon up to the walls. </p>

                        land side were in very great difficulties. Not only were they baffled by the
                        height of the walls, but as they approached them they were open to showers
                        of missiles on both hands, so that their sides were more exposed than their
                        front. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In the other direction, however,
                        the 500 found their passage through the lake and their ascent from there to
                        the foot of the walls an easy matter. No fortifications had been constructed
                        on this side, as it was considered to be sufficiently protected by the lake
                        and by the nature of the ground, nor were there any outposts or pickets on
                        guard against any attack, as all were intent on rendering assistance where
                        danger was actually visible. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They entered
                        the city without meeting any opposition, and at once marched full speed to
                        the gate round which all the fighting had gathered. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> All had their attention absorbed in the struggle; even
                        the eyes and ears of the combatants, as of those who <milestone n="5??"
                            unit="section"/> were watching and cheering them on, were so riveted on
                        the fighting that not a single man was aware that the city behind him was
                        captured until the missiles began to fall upon them from the rear.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Now that they had the enemy in front
                        and rear they gave up the defence, the walls were seized, the gate was
                        battered from both sides, smashed to pieces, and carried out of the way to
                        allow a free passage to the troops. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> A
                        large number surmounted the walls and inflicted heavy slaughter on the
                        townsmen, but those who entered through the gate marched in unbroken ranks
                        through the heart of the city into the forum. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> From this point Scipio saw the enemy retreating in two
                        directions; one body was making for a hill to the east of the city, which
                        was being held by a detachment of 500 men; the others were going to the
                        citadel where Mago, together with the men who had been driven from the
                        walls, had taken refuge. Sending a force to storm the hill, he led the rest
                        of his troops against the citadel. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                        hill was taken at the first charge, and Mago, seeing that the whole of the
                        city was in occupation of the enemy, and that his own position was hopeless,
                        surrendered the citadel and its defenders. <milestone n="10" unit="section"
                        /> Until the citadel was surrendered the carnage went on everywhere
                        throughout the city, no adult male who was met with was spared, but on its
                        surrender the signal was given and an end put to the slaughter. The victors
                        then turned their attention to the plunder, of which there was a vast amount

                        there were the Spanish hostages; these he treated with as much consideration

                        were well-nigh worn out; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> they had fought
                        in the open field, had undergone much toil and danger in the capture of the
                        city, and after capturing it had sustained a conflict on unfavourable ground
                        with those who had taken refuge in the citadel. So he gave them one day's
                        respite from all military duties and ordered them to seek refreshment and
                        rest. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The next day he issued orders for
                        all the soldiers and marines to appear on parade that he might address them.
                        First he offered up a thanksgiving to the immortal gods because they had not
                        only made him master in a single day of the wealthiest city in all Spain,
                        but had also brought together beforehand into the place all the resources of
                        Africa and Spain, so that whilst nothing was left to the enemy he and his
                        men had a superabundance of everything. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        Then he praised the courage of his troops, whom, he said, nothing had
                        daunted, neither the sortie of the enemy, nor the height of the walls, nor
                        the untried depth of the lagoon, nor the fort on the hill, nor the unusual
                        strength of the citadel. Nothing had prevented them from surmounting every
                        obstacle and forcing their way everywhere. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Though every man amongst them deserved all the rewards he could give, the
                        glory of the mural crown belonged especially to him who was the first to
                        scale the wall, and the man who considered that he deserved it should claim
                        it. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Two men came forward, Q. Tiberilius, a
                        centurion of the fourth legion, and Sextus Digitius, one of the marines. The
                        contention between them was not so heated as the excitement with which each
                        body advocated the claim of its own representative. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> C. Laelius, the commander of the fleet, supported the
                        marine, M. Sempronius Tuditanus took the part of his legionaries. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> As the dispute was almost becoming a mutiny,
                        Scipio announced that he would allow three arbitrators to be named who
                        should investigate the case and take evidence and give their decision as to
                        which had been the first to scale the wall and enter the town. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> C. Laelius and M. Sempronius were named by their
                        respective parties, and Scipio added the name of P. Cornelius Caudinus, who
                        belonged to neither party, and bade the three sit at once and try the case
                        judicially. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> As they proceeded, the
                        dispute became hotter than ever, for the two men whose dignity and authority
                        had helped to restrain the excitement were now withdrawn to the tribunal. At
                        last Laelius left his colleagues and stepped down in front of the tribunal
                        to Scipio and pointed out to him that the proceedings were being carried on
                        in defiance of all order and self-restraint, and the men were almost coming
                        to blows. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> And even if there were no
                        resort to violence the precedent that was being set was none the less
                        detestable, since men were trying to win the reward of valour by falsehood
                        and perjury. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> On the one side were the
                        soldiers of the legion, on the other those of the fleet, all alike ready to
                        swear by all the gods to what they wanted rather than to what they knew to
                        be true, and prepared to involve in the guilt of perjury not themselves
                        only, but the military standards, the eagles and their solemn oath of
                        allegiance. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Laelius added that he was
                        making these representations to him at the wish of P. Cornelius and M.
                        Sempronius. Scipio approved of the step Laelius had taken and summoned the
                        troops to assembly. He then announced that he had definitely ascertained
                        that Q. Tiberilius and Sextius Digitius had both surmounted the wall at the
                        same moment, and he should honour their bravery by presenting them each with
                        a mural crown. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Then he bestowed rewards
                        upon the rest according to each man's merit. C. Laelius, the commander of
                        the fleet, was singled out for special distinction, and in the praises which
                        he lavished upon him he placed him on an equality with himself, finally
                        presenting him with a golden crown and thirty oxen. </p>

                        to give their number, for I find in one place 300 mentioned and in another
                        3724. There is a similar discrepancy amongst the authorities on other
                        points. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> One author asserts that the
                        Carthaginian garrison amounted to 10,000 men, another puts it at 7000,
                        whilst a third estimates it as not more than 2000. In one place you will
                        find that there were 10,000 prisoners, in another the number is said to have
                        exceeded 25,000. If I followed the Greek author Silenus <milestone n="3??"
                            unit="section"/> I should give the number of scorpions large and small
                        as 60; according to Valerius Antias there were 6000 large ones and 13,000
                        small ones; so wildly do men invent. It is even a matter of dispute who were
                        in command. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Most authorities agree that
                        Laelius was in command of the fleet, but there are some who say that it was
                        M. Junius Silanus. Antias tells us that Arines was the Carthaginian
                        commandant when the garrison surrendered, other writers say it was Mago.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Nor are authors agreed as to the
                        number of ships that were captured, or the weight of gold and silver, or the
                        amount of money that was brought into the treasury. <milestone n="6"

                        Scipio began by reassuring them and dispelling their fears. <milestone n="7"

                        foreign nations united to them on terms of alliance and mutual good faith
                        than kept down in hard and hopeless servitude. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> He then ascertained the names of the States from which
                        they came and made an inventory of the number belonging to each State.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Messengers were then despatched to
                        their homes, bidding their friends to come and take charge of those who

                        and flinging herself in tears at the general's feet implored him to impress
                        more strongly on their guards the duty of treating the women with tenderness
                        and consideration. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Scipio assured her
                        that nothing would be wanting in this respect. Then she continued: "We do

                        artisans of every kind who were kept together in the Government workshops.
                        The general devoted his attention equally to everything. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> At one time he was present with the fleet watching a
                        naval encounter; at another he was exercising his legions; then he would be
                        giving some hours to an inspection of the work which was going on in the
                        shops and in the arsenal and dockyards, where the vast number of artisans
                        were vying with each other as to who could work the hardest. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> After starting these various undertakings and
                        seeing that the damaged portions of the walls were repaired, he started for
                        Tarraco, leaving a detachment in the city for its protection. <milestone
                            n="10" unit="section"/> On his way he was met by numerous delegations;
                        some of them he dismissed, after giving his reply while still on the march;
                        others he put off till he reached Tarraco, where he had given notice to all
                        the allies, old and new, to meet him. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        Almost all the tribes south of the Ebro obeyed the summons, as did many also
                        from the northern province. The Carthaginian generals did their best to
                        suppress any rumours of the fall of New Carthage, then when the facts came
                        out too clearly to be either suppressed or perverted, they tried to minimise
                        its importance. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> It was by a sudden ruse,
                        almost by stealth, they said, that one city out of the whole of Spain had
                        been filched from them in a single day; a young swaggerer elated with this
                        trifling success had in the intoxication of his delight made believe that it
                        was a great victory. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> But when he learnt
                        that three generals and three victorious armies were bearing down upon him
                        he would be painfully reminded of the deaths which had already visited his
                        family. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> This was what they told people
                        generally, but they themselves were perfectly aware how much their strength
                        was in every way weakened by the loss of New Carthage. </p>
