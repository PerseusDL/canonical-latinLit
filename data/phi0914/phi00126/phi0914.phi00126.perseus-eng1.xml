                    <name>Tiberius</name> Sempronius, though he had been given an army of slaves, by
                    his training and authority had soon brought it about that no one of them in

                    a terror to enemies. <reg>they</reg> had rescued Cumae, Beneventum <note

                    restored them to the Roman people. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>but</reg> Gnaeus Fulvius, having an army of Roman citizens, <note

                        to heighten the contrast with slaves. </note> men well born and brought up
                    as free men, had steeped them in the vices of slaves. <reg>consequently</reg>
                    this was what he had accomplished: that they were overbearing and turbulent in
                    their dealings with allies, cowardly and unwarlike towards the enemy, and unable
                    to withstand even the battle —cry of the Carthaginians, to say nothing of their
                    attack. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>and</reg> surely it was no wonder that the soldiers had given way in
                    battle, when their commander was the first of all to flee. <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/>
                    <reg>he</reg> wondered more, he said, that some had fallen where they stood, and
                    that not all had shared the consternation and flight of Gnaeus Fulvius.
                        <name>Gaius</name> Flaminius, Lucius Paulus, Lucius Postumius, Gnaeus and
                    Publius Scipio had preferred to fall in battle —line rather than to desert their

                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 211</note> had returned to Rome.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>it</reg> was a shameful thing that the army of Cannae, for having escaped
                    from the battle —line, had been deported to Sicily, not to be relieved of
                    service there until the enemy withdrew from Italy, and that the same action had
                    been taken recently in the case of Gnaeus Fulvius' legions; <milestone n="15"

                    his own recklessness should have gone unpunished, and he should be expecting to

                    whereas the soldiers, whose only fault was that they were like their commander,
                    had been all but exiled and were enduring military service in disgrace.

                    <reg>so</reg> different was freedom at Rome for the rich and the poor, for the

                    on the following day, and although drawn up at a favourable time and place, they
                    failed to withstand the reputed or the real strength of the enemy. <milestone

                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>it</reg> was not that for lack of supplies he had been imprudently led into
                    an unfavourable position; it was not that while advancing in column without

                    inspected everything with the same care; now he was on the fleet and the docks,
                    now he was with the legions as they ran; now he was giving his time to viewing
                    the work that was done from day to day in shops and arsenal and on the docks,
                    with the utmost rivalry, by the great multitude of artisans. <milestone n="9"

                    <reg>having</reg> made such a beginning, and having repaired battered parts of
                    the wall, and leaving forces posted to defend the city, he set out for Tarraco,
                    being approached by many embassies in the course of his march. <milestone n="10"

                    <reg>some</reg> of these he answered and dismissed without stopping, some he
                    postponed till he reached Tarraco, at which he had announced an assembly for all

                    their language would minimize it, saying that by a sudden arrival and almost by
                    stealth on a single day a single city of Spain had been seized; and carried away
                    by success on so small a scale, an arrogant youth in an excess of joy had given
                    it the appearance of a great victory; <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> but
                    when he heard that three generals, three victorious armies of the enemy were
                    approaching, there would at once come to him the memory of the losses in his
                    family. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>such</reg> were their remarks in public, but in themselves they were by no
                    means unaware what a mass of resources for every purpose had gone with the loss
                    of (New) Carthage. </p>
