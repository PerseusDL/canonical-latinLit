                        the senate, they propose that, if they wished for peace, they should elect
                        one of the consuls from among the Latins. Titus Manlius, the consul, put his
                        son to death, because he had fought, though successfully, against the
                        Latins, contrary to orders. The Romans being hard pressed in the battle,
                        Publius Decius, then consul with Manlius, devoted himself for the army. The
                        Latins surrender. None of the young men came out to meet Manlius on his
                        return to the city. Minucia, a vestal virgin was con- demned for incest.

                        expiration of his office, and of triumph decreed to any person not a consul.
                        Law against confinement for debt. Quintus Fabius, master of the horse,
                        fights the Samnites with success, contrary to the orders of Lucius Papirius,
                        dictator; and, with difficulty, obtains pardon, through the intercession of
                        the people. Successful expe- dition against the Samnites. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> THE consuls now were Caius Plautius a second
                    time, and Lucius Aemilius Mamercinus; when the people of Setia and Norba came to
                    Rome to announce the revolt of he Privernians, with complaints of the damages
                    received by them. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> News were brought that the
                    army of the Volscians, under the guidance of the people of Antium, had taken
                    post at Satricum. Both wars fell by lot to Plautius. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> He, marching first to Privernum, immediately came to an
                    engagement. The enemy were defeated after a slight resistance: the town was
                    taken, and given back to the Privernians, a strong garrison being placed in it:
                    two thirds of their land were taken front them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    /> The victorious army was marched thence to Satricum against the Antians; there
                    a desperate battle was fought with great slaughter on both sides; and when a
                    storm separated the combatants, hope inclining to neither side, the Romans,
                    nowise disheartened by this so indecisive an engagement, pre- <pb n="504"

                        unit="section"/> The Volscians, reckoning up what men they had lost in
                    battle, had by no means the same spirits to repeat the risk. They went off in
                    the night to Antium as a vanquished army in the utmost confusion, leaving behind
                    their wounded and a part of their baggage. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> A
                    vast quantity of arms was found, both among the dead bodies of the enemy, and
                    also in the camp. These, the consul declared, that he offered up to Mother Lua;
                    and he laid waste the enemy's country as far as the sea-coast. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The other consul, Aemilius, on entering the Sabellan
                    territory, found neither a camp of the Samnites nor legions opposed to him.
                    Whilst he laid waste their territories with fire and sword, the ambassadors of
                    the Samnites came to him, suing for peace; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> by
                    whom being referred to the senate, after leave to address them was granted,
                    laying aside their ferocious spirits, they sued for peace for themselves from
                    the Romans, and the right of waging war against the Sidicinians. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/> Which requests, [they alleged,] that <quote> they
                        were the more justified in making, because they had both united in
                        friendship with the Roman people, when their affairs were flourishing, not
                        under circumstances of distress, as the Campanians had done, and they were
                        taking up arms against the Sidicinians, ever their enemies, never the
                        friends of the Roman people; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> who had
                        neither, as the Samnites, sought their friendship in time of peace, nor, as
                        the Campanians, their assistance in time of war, and were neither in
                        alliance with, nor under subjection to the Roman people. </quote>

                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After the praetor Tiberius Aemilius had
                    consulted the senate respecting the demands of the Samnites, and the senate
                    voted that the treaty should be renewed with them, the praetor returned this
                    answer to the Samnites: <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> "That it neither had
                    been the fault of the Roman people that their friendship with them was not
                    perpetual; nor was any objection made to that friendship being once more
                    re-established, since they themselves were now become tired of a war entered
                    into through their own fault. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> With respect to
                    what regarded the Sidicinians, they did not interfere with the Samnite nation
                    having the free decision of peace and war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                    treaty being concluded, on their return home, the Roman army was immediately
                    withdrawn after they had received a year's pay, and corn for three months: for
                    which the consul had stipulated, to grant time for a truce, <pb n="505"
                        xml:id="p.505"/> until the ambassadors should return. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> The Samnites having marched against the Sidicinians with
                    the same force which they had employed in their war against the Romans, enter-
                    tained rather sanguine hopes of becoming masters of the ene- mies' citadel.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then the Sidicinians first began to
                    surrender to the Romans. Afterwards, when the senate rejected that offer as too
                    late, and as being wrung from them by extreme necessity, it was made to the
                    Latins, who were already taking up arms on their own account. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Nor did even the Campanians (so much stronger was their
                    recollection of the injuries done them by the Samnites than of the kindness of
                    the Romans) keep themselves from this quarrel. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    Out of these so many states, one vast army, entering the territories of the
                    Samnites under the direction of the Latins, committed more damage by
                    depredations than by battles; and though the Latins had the advantage in the
                    field, they retired out of the enemies' territory without reluctance, that they
                    might not be obliged to fight too frequently. This opportunity was afforded to
                    the Samnites to send ambassadors to Rome. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When
                    they appeared before the senate, having complained that they, though now
                    confederates, were subjected to the same hardships as those they had suffered as
                    enemies, solicited, with the humblest entreaties, that <quote> the Romans would
                        think it enough <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> the victory, of which
                        they had deprived the Samnites, over their Campanian and Sidicinian enemy;
                        that they would not besides suffer them to be vanquished by these most
                        dastardly states. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> That they could by
                        their sovereign authority keep the Latins and the Campanians out of the
                        Samnite territory, if they really were under the dominion of the Roman
                        people; but if they rejected their authority, that they might compel them by
                        arms. </quote>
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> To this an equivocal answer was returned,
                    because it was mortifying to acknowledge, that the Latins were not now in their
                    power, and they were afraid lest by finding fault they might estrange them from
                    their side: <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> that the case of the Campanians
                    was different, they having come under their protection, not by treaty but by
                    surrender: accordingly, that the Campanians, whether they wished or not, should
                    remain quiet: that in the Latin treaty there was no clause by which they were
                    prevented from going to war with whomsoever they pleased. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Which answer, whilst it sent away the Samnites
                    uncertain <pb n="506" xml:id="p.506"/> as to what conduct they were to think
                    that the Romans would pursue, it further estranged the Campanians through fear;
                    it rendered the Samnites more presuming, they considering that there was nothing
                    which the Romans would now refuse them. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Wherefore, proclaiming frequent meetings under the pretext of preparing for war
                    against the Samnites, their leading men, in their several deliberations among
                    themselves, secretly fomented the plan of a war with Rome. In this war the
                    Campanians too joined against their preservers. <milestone n="3" unit="section"
                    /> But though all their schemes were carefully concealed, and they were anxious
                    that their Samnite enemy should be got rid of in their rear before the Romans
                    should be aroused, yet through the agency of some who were attached [to the
                    latter] by private <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> friendships and other
                    ties, information of their conspiracy made its way to Rome, and the consuls
                    being ordered to resign their office before the usual time, in order that the
                    new consuls might be elected the sooner to meet so important a war, a religious
                    scruple entered their minds at the idea of the elections being held by persons
                    whose time of office had been cut short. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly an interregnum took place. There were two interreges, Marcus
                    Valerius and Marcus Fabius. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The consuls
                    elected were Titus Manlius Torquatus a third time, and Publius Decius Mus. It is
                    agreed on that, in this year, Alexander, king of Epirus, made a descent on Italy
                    with a fleet. Which war, if the first commencement had been sufficiently
                    successful, would unquestionably have extended to the Romans. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The same was the era of the exploits of Alexander the
                    Great, whom, being son to the other's sister, in another region of the world,
                    having shown himself invincible in war, fortune cut short in his youth by
                    disease. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But the Romans, although the revolt
                    of their allies and of the Latin nation was now no matter of doubt, yet as if
                    they felt solicitude regarding the Samnites, not for themselves, summoned ten of
                    the leading men of the Latins to Rome, to whom they wished to issue such orders
                    as they might wish. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Latium had at that time
                    two praetors, Lucius Annius, a native of Setia, and Lucius Numisius of Circeii,
                    both from the Roman colonists; through whose means, be- sides Signia and
                    Velitrae, also Roman colonies, the Volscians too had been stirred up to arms.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> It was determined that these two should
                    be summoned specially; it was a matter of <pb n="507" xml:id="p.507"/> doubt to
                    no one, on what matter they were sent for. Accordingly the praetors, having held
                    an assembly, before they set out for Rome, inform them, that they were summoned
                    by the Roman senate, and consult them as to what answer it was their wish should
                    be given on those subjects which they thought would be discussed with them. </p>
                <milestone n="4" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When different persons advanced different
                    opinions, then Annius says: <quote> Though I myself put the question, as to what

                    stood to this day, and have brought me to this necessity, that I must either

                    attended to, such severity was also profitable in the final struggle when they

                    was very like to a civil war; so very similar was every thing among the Romans
                    and Latins, except with respect to courage. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    The Romans formerly used targets; afterwards, when they began to receive pay,
                    they made shields instead of targets; and what before constituted phalanxes
                    similar to the Macedonian, afterwards became a line drawn up in distinct
                    companies. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At length they were divided into
                    several centuries. A century contained sixty soldiers, two centurions, and one
                    standard-bearer. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The spearmen (hastati) formed
                    the first line in fifteen companies, with small intervals between them: a
                    company had twenty light-armed soldiers, the rest wearing shields; those were
                    called light who carried only a spear and short iron javelins. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> This, which constituted the van in the field of battle,
                    contained the youth in early bloom advancing towards the age of service. Next
                    followed men of more robust age, in the same number of companies, who were
                    called principes, all wearing shields, and distinguished by the completest
                    armour. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> This band of thirty companies they
                    called antepilani, because there were fifteen others placed behind them with the
                    standards; of which each company consisted of three divisions, and the first
                    division of each they called a pilus. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Each
                    company consisted of three ensigns, and contained one hundred and eighty-six
                    men. The first ensign was at the head of the Triarii, veteran soldiers of tried
                    bravery; the second, at the head of the Rorarii, men whose ability was less by
                    reason of their age and course of service; the third, at the head of the
                    Accensi, a body in whom very little confidence was reposed. For this reason also
                    they were thrown <pb n="514" xml:id="p.514"/> back to the rear. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> When the army was marshalled according to this arrangement,
                    the spearmen first commenced the fight. If the spearmen were unable to repulse
                    the enemy, they retreated leisurely, and were received by the principes into the
                    intervals of the ranks. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The fight then
                    devolved on the principes; the spearmen followed. The Triarii continued kneeling
                    behind the ensigns, their left leg extended forward, holding their shields
                    resting on their shoulders, and their spears fixed in the ground, with the
                    points erect, so that their line bristled as if enclosed by a rampart.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> If the principes also did not make
                    sufficient impression in the fight, they retreated slowly from the front to the
                    Triarii. Hence, when a difficulty is felt, <quote>Matters have come to the

                    The Triarii rising up, after receiving the principes and spearmen into the
                    intervals between their ranks, immediately closing their files, shut up as it
                    were the openings; <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> and in one compact body
                    fell upon the enemy, no other hope being now left: that was the most formidable

                        unit="section"/> In general about four legions were raised, each consisting

                    only standard with standard, spearmen with spearmen, principles with principes,

                    among the veterans two first centurions in either army, the Roman by no means
                    possessing bodily strength, but a brave man, and experienced in the service; the

                    destined to be his adversary; and this youth being opposed to him in the battle,
                    obtained the victory over the Latin centurion. <milestone n="19" unit="section"

                    whether citizens or allies, the principal praise for that action was due to the

                    (denounced) by the divinities of heaven and hell; the other evinced such valour
                    and such judgment in the battle, that it was universally agreed among both the

                    that, on whichever side Titus Manlius held the command, the victory must belong

                    themselves to Minturnae. Immediately after the battle the camp was taken, and
                    great numbers still alive were surprised therein, chiefly Campanians. Night

                    it is not lawful that a Roman magistrate should pass. But if he wish to devote

                    people inhabited the city Cales; they had united their arms with their

                    the two states being defeated in one battle scarcely worthy of record, was
                    induced to take to flight the earlier in consequence of the proximity of the
                    cities, and the more sheltered on their flight. Nor did the senate, however,
                    discontinue their attention to that war, because the Sidicinians had now so
                    often taken up arms either as principals, or had afforded aid to those who did
                    so, or had been the cause of hostilities. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly they exerted themselves with all their might, to raise to the

                    Regulus as colleague; and lest any disappointment might by any chance occur, a

                    be assigned to Corvus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Receiving the

                    were disheartened by the recollection also of the former engagement, he set
                    about attacking the town itself. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And such was
                    the ardour of the soldiers, that they wished to advance immediately up to the

                        unit="section"/> Corvus, because that was a hazardous undertaking, wished to
                    accomplish his object rather by the labour than the risk of his men. Accordingly
                    he formed a rampart, prepared his vineae and advanced towers up to the walls;
                    but an opportunity which accidentally presented itself, prevented the occasion
                    for them. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> For Marcius Fabius, a Roman

                    There because the Sidicinians, who had raised a numerous army, seemed determined

                    had been infected by that irregularity. By Marcus Valerius Corvus, the fifth

                    the Samnites to another quarter; these two nations fought a pitched battle
                    against the king, as he was making a descent on the district adjoining Paestum.

                    the informer who confronted them to drink some, that they might convict her of

                    repaired to Privernum in trepidation, so that they might protect themselves
                    rather by walls than by a rampart. Plautius, the other consul, after laying

                    stripped, and destitute of every thing; all, in short, belonging to them being
                    left with their enemies; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> so that they were
                    objects of ridicule, not only to foreigners, but even to their own countrymen.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> I know that there is another account of
                    this matter, according to which the town is represented to have been betrayed by
                    the Samnites; but I have this account on the authority most worthy of credit;
                    besides, the treaty of Neapolis, for to that place the seat of government of the
                    Greeks was then transferred, renders it more probable that the renewal of
                    friendship was voluntary on their side. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> A
                    triumph was decreed to Publilius, because people were well convinced that the
                    enemy, reduced by the siege, had adopted terms of submission. These two
                    extraordi- nary incidents, which never before occurred in any case, befell this
                    man: a prolongation of command never before granted to any one; and a triumph
                    after the expiration of his office. </p>

                    that city, as if they were the persons who had suffered the disappointment, and
                    not the authors of it, they inveighed against the Palaepolitans, and became
                    furious in their anger and malice towards the Romans; on this account also,
                    because information was brought that the Lucanians and Apulians had submitted to

                        received as masters: that, in fact, their interests were involved in the war
                        of the Samnites, and in its issue. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> That

                        yet be brought back, and induced to renounce the Roman alliance, if proper

                    been thus beaten with rods, by order of the consul, and had hardly escaped the

                    the magistrates to call together the senate; and some standing round that
                    assembly, insisted on a declaration of war against the Romans, others ran
                    different ways to rouse to arms the multitude residing in the country.

                    also to receive garrisons into their fortified places; and they, blinded by

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> This year there arose, as it were, a new era
                    of liberty to the Roman commons; in this that a stop was put to the practice of
                    confining debtors. This alteration of the law was effected in consequence of the
                    lust and signal cruelty of one usurer. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    <pb n="541" xml:id="p.541"/> His name was Lucius Papirius. To him one Caius
                    Publilius having surrendered his person to be confined for a debt due by his
                    father, his youth and beauty, which ought to have excited commiseration,
                    operated on the other's mind as incentives to lust and insult. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> He first attempted to seduce the young man by impure
                    discourses, considering the bloom of his youth his own adventitious gain; but
                    finding that his ears were shocked at their infamous tendency, he then
                    endeavoured to terrify him by threats, and reminded him frequently of his
                    situation. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> At last, convinced of his
                    resolution to act conformably to his honour- able birth, rather than to his
                    present condition, he ordered him to be stripped and scourged. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> When with the marks of the rods imprinted in his flesh the
                    youth rushed out into the public street, loudly complaining of the depravedness
                    and inhumanity of the usurer; <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> a vast number of
                    people, moved by compassion for his early age, and indignation at his barbarous
                    treatment, reflecting at the same time on their own lot and that of their
                    children, flocked together into the forum, and from thence in a body to the
                    senate-house. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When the consuls were obliged by
                    the sudden tumult to call a meeting of the senate, the people, falling at the
                    feet of each of the senators, as they were going into the senate-house,
                    presented to their view the lace- rated back of the youth. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> On that day, in consequence of the outrageous conduct of an
                    individual, the strongest bonds of credit were broken; and the consuls were
                    commanded to propose to the people, that no person should be held in fetters or
                    stocks, except convicted of a crime, and in order to punish- ment; but that, for
                    money due, the goods of the debtor, not his person, should be answerable.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Thus the confined debtors were released;

                    the Samnites was sufficient in itself to give full employment to the senate,
                    besides the sudden defection of the Lucanians, and the Tarentines, the promoters
                    of the defection, [another source of uneasiness] was added in a union formed by
                    the state of the Vestinians with the Samnites. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Which event, though it con- tinued, during the present year, to be the general
                    subject of con- versation, without coming under any public discussion, appeared
                    so important to the consuls of the year following, Lucius Fu- rius Camillus a
                    second time, and Junius Brutus Scaeva, that it <pb n="542" xml:id="p.542"/> was
                    the first business which they proposed to the consideration of the state.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And though the matter was still recent,
                    still great perplexity seized the senate, as they dreaded equally the
                    consequences, either of passing it over, or of taking it up; lest, on the one
                    hand, impunity might stir up the neighbouring states with wantonness and
                    arrogance; and, on the other, punishment inflicted on them by force of arms, and
                    dread of immediate danger, might produce the same effect by exciting resentment.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> And the whole body, too, was in every way
                    equal in strength to the Samnites, being composed of the Marsians, the
                    Pelignians, and the Marrusinians; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> all of whom
                    would have to be encountered as enemies, if the Vestinians were to be interfered
                    with. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> However, that side prevailed which
                    might, at the time, seem to have more spirit than prudence; but the event proved
                    that fortune assists the brave. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The people, in
                    pursuance of the direction of the senate, ordered war against the Vestinians;
                    that province fell by lot to Junius, Samnium to Camillus. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Armies were led to both places, and by carefully guarding
                    the frontiers, the enemy were prevented from joining their forces. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/> But the other consul, Lucius Furius, on whom the
                    principal weight of the business rested, was withdrawn by chance from the war,
                    being seized with a severe sickness. Being therefore ordered to nominate a
                    dictator to conduct the business, he nominated Lucius Papirius Cursor, the most
                    celebrated general, by far, of any in that age, who appointed Quintus Fabius
                    Maximus Rullianus master of the horse: <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> a pair
                    of commanders distinguished for their exploits in war; more so, however, for a

                        n="11" unit="section"/> The other consul, in the territory of the
                    Vestinians, carried on operations of various kinds; and, in all, was uniformly
                    successful. For he both utterly laid waste their lands, and, by spoiling and
                    burning their houses and corn, compelled them to come to an engagement;
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> and, in one battle, he reduced the
                    strength of the Vestinians to such a degree, though not without loss on his own
                    side, that the enemy not only fled to their camp, but, fearing even to trust to
                    the rampart and trench, dispersed from thence into the several towns, in hopes
                    of finding security in the situation and fortifications of their cities.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> At last, having undertaken to reduce
                    their towns by force, amid the great ardour of the soldiers, and their
                    resentment for the wounds which they <pb n="543" xml:id="p.543"/> had received,
                    (hardly one of them having come out of the battle unhurt,) he took Cutina by

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The commanders entered Samnium under uncertain
                    auspices; an informality which pointed, not at the event of war, for that was
                    prosperous, but at the furious passions and the quarrels which broke out between
                    the leaders. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> For Papirius the dictator,
                    returning to Rome in order to take the auspices anew, in consequence of a
                    caution received from the aruspex, left strict orders with the master of the
                    horse to remain in his post, and not to engage in battle during his absence.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> After the departure of the dictator,
                    Fabius having discovered by his scouts that the enemy were in as unguarded a
                    state as if there was not a single Roman in Samnium, the high-spirited youth,
                    (either conceiving <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> indignation at the sole
                    authority in every point appearing to be lodged in the hands of the dictator, or
                    induced by the opportunity of striking an important blow,) having made the
                    necessary preparations and dispositions, marched to a place called Imbrinium,
                    and there fought a battle with the Samnites. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    His success in the fight was such, that there was no one circumstance which
                    could have been improved to more advantage, if the dictator had been present.
                    The leader was not wanting to the soldiers, nor the soldier to their leader.

                    them on so furiously, that no power could withstand them; forcing their way
                    through the thickest of the enemy, they bore down every thing before them; and
                    the in- fantry seconding the charge, the whole body was thrown into confusion.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Twenty thousand of the enemy are said to
                    have fallen on that day. I have authority for saying that there were two battles

                    The master of the horse getting possession of abundance of spoils, in

                    plainly that he wished not to impart to him any share of the honour; who
                    certainly viewed the proceeding in this light, for while others rejoiced at the

                    the master of the horse, than were the dictatorial dignity and military

                        unit="section"/> Their infantry did not even quit their camp before
                    daylight. As soon as it was dawn, the cavalry venturing to attack the enemy by
                    harassing the Roman rear, and pressing them in places of difficult passage,
                    considerably delayed their march. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Meanwhile
                    their infantry overtook the cavalry; and now the Samnites pursued close with
                    their entire force. The dictator then, finding that he could no longer go
                    forward without great inconvenience, ordered the spot where he stood to be
                    measured out for a camp. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But it was
                    impossible, while the enemy's horse were spread about on every side, that
                    palisades could be brought, and the work be begun: seeing it, therefore,
                    impracticable, either to march forward or to settle himself there, he drew up
                    his troops for battle, removing the baggage out of the line. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> The enemy likewise formed their line opposite to his; fully
                    equal both in spirit and in strength. Their courage was chiefly improved from
                    not knowing that the motive of the Romans' retreat was the incommodiousness of
                    the ground, so that they imagined themselves objects of terror, and supposed
                    that they were pursuing men who fled through fear. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> This kept the balance of the fight equal for a considerable
                    time; though, of late, it had been unusual with the Samnites to stand even the
                    shout of a Roman army. Certain it is, that the contest, on this day, continued
                    so very doubtful from the third hour to the eighth, that neither was the shout
                    repeated, after being raised at the first onset, nor the standards moved either
                    forward or backward; nor any ground lost on either side. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> They fought without taking breath or looking behind them,
                    every man in his post, and pushing against their opponents with their shields.
                    The noise continuing equal, and the terror of the fight the same, seemed to
                    denote, that the decision would be effected either by fatigue or by the night.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The men had now exhausted their strength,
                    the sword its power, and the leaders their skill; when, on a sudden, the Samnite
                    cavalry, having learned from a single troop which had advanced beyond the rest,
                    that the baggage of the Romans lay at a distance from their army, without any
                    guard or defence; through eagerness for booty, they attack it: of which the
                    dictator being informed by a hasty messenger, said, <quote> Let them only
                        encumber themselves with <pb n="556" xml:id="p.556"/> spoils. </quote>
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Afterwards came several, one after another,
                    crying out, that they were plundering and carrying off all the effects of the
                    soldiers: <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> he then called to him the master of
                    the horse, and said, <quote> Do you see, Marcus Fabius, that the fight has been
                        forsaken by the enemy's cavalry? They are entangled and encumbered with our
                        baggage. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Attack them whilst scattered
                        about, as is the case of every multitude employed in plundering; you will
                        find few mounted on horseback, few with swords in their hands; and, while
                        they are loading their horses with spoil, and unarmed, put them to the
                        sword, and make it bloody spoil for them. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                        I will take care of the legions, and the fight of the infantry: yours be the
                        honour which the horse shall acquire. </quote>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The body of cavalry, in the most exact order
                    possible, charging the enemy, who were straggling and embarrassed, filled every
                    place with slaughter: <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> for amid the packages
                    which they hastily threw down, and which lay in the way of their feet, and of
                    the affrighted horses, as they endeavoured to escape, being now unable either to
                    fight or fly, they are slaughtered. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Then
                    Fabius, after he had almost entirely cut off the enemy's horse, led round his
                    squadrons in a small circuit, and attacked the infantry in the rear. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> The new shout, raised in that quarter, terrified the
                    Samnites on the one hand; and when, on the other, the dictator saw their troops
                    in the van looking behind them, their battalions in confusion, and their line
                    wavering, he earnestly exhorted and animated his men, calling on the tribunes
                    and chief centurions, by name, to join him in renewing the fight. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> Raising the shout anew, they pressed forward, and as
                    they advanced, perceived the enemy more and more confused. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> The cavalry now could be seen by those in front, and
                    Cornelius, turning about to the several companies, made them understand, by
                    raising his voice and hands, that he saw the standards and bucklers of his own
                    horsemen. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On hearing which, and at the same
                    time seeing them, they, at once, so far forgot the fatigue which they had
                    endured through almost the whole day, and even their wounds, that they rushed on
                    against the enemy with as much vigour and alacrity as if they were coming fresh
                    out of camp on receiving the signal for battle. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                    /> The Samnites could no longer sustain the charge of horse and foot together;
                    part of them, enclosed on both sides, were cut off; the rest were scattered and
                    fled different ways. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The infantry slew those
                        <pb n="557" xml:id="p.557"/> who were surrounded and made resistance; and
                    the cavalry made great havoc of the fugitives, among whom fell their general.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> This battle crushed, at length, the power
                    of the Samnites so effectually, that, in all their meetings, they said, <quote>
                        it was not at all to be wondered at, if in an impious war, commenced in
                        violation of a treaty, when the gods were, with justice, more incensed
                        against them than men, they succeeded in none of their undertakings.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> That war must be expiated and atoned
                        for with a heavy penalty. The only alternative they had, was whether the
                        penalty should be the guilty blood of a few, or the innocent blood of all. </quote>
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Some now ventured to name the authors of the
                    war; one name in particular, by the united voices of all, was mentioned, that of
                    Brutulus Papius; he was a man of power and noble birth, and undoubtedly the
                    violator of the late truce. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The praetors
                    being compelled to take the opinion of the assembly concerning him, a decree was
                    made, <quote> that Brutulus Papius should be delivered into the hands of the
                        Romans; and that, together with him all the spoil taken from the Romans, and
                        the prisoners, should be sent to Rome, and that the restitution demanded by
                        the heralds, in conformity to treaty, should be made as was agreeable to
                        justice and equity. </quote>
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> In pursuance of this determination heralds
                    were sent to Rome, and also the dead body of Brutulus; for, by a voluntary
                    death, he avoided the punishment and ignominy intended for him. <milestone
                        n="15" unit="section"/> It was thought proper that his goods also should be
                    delivered up along with the body. But none of all those things were accepted,
                    except the prisoners, and such articles of the spoil as were recognised by the
                    owners. The dictator obtained a triumph by a decree of the senate. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Some writers affirm, that this war was
                    conducted by the consuls, and that they triumphed over the Samnites and also,
                    that Fabius advanced into Apulia, and carried off from thence abundance of
                    spoil. But that Aulus Cornelius was dictator that year is an undisputed fact.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Th question then is, whether he was
                    appointed for the purpose of conducting the war, or on occasion of the illness
                    of Lucius Plautius, the praetor; in order that there might be a magistrate to
                    give the signal for the starting of the chariots at the Roman games. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> This latter is asserted of him; and that after
                    performing the business, which in truth reflected no great lustre on his office,
                        <pb n="558" xml:id="p.558"/> he resigned the dictatorship. It is not easy to
                    determine between either the facts or the writers, which of them deserves the
                    preference: <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> I am inclined to think that
                    history has been much corrupted by means of funeral panegyrics and false
                    inscriptions on statues; each family striving by false representations to
                    appropriate to itself the fame of warlike exploits and public honours.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> From this cause, certainly, both the
                    actions of individuals and the public records of events have been confused. Nor
                    is there extant any writer, contemporary with those events, on whose authority
                    we can with certainty rely. </p>
