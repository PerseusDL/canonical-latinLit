                    brought tidings to Rome that the Privernates were in revolt, with complaints of
                    a defeat suffered at their hands. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>it</reg> was also reported that a Volscian army, conducted by the Antiates,
                    had encamped at Satricum. <reg>both</reg> wars were by lot assigned to Plautius.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>he</reg> marched first on Privernum and at once gave battle.
                        <reg>without</reg> much ado he overcame the enemy, captured Privernum, and
                    putting in it a strong garrison, restored it to the inhabitants, but deprived
                    them of two —thirds of their territory. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>thence</reg> he led his victorious army towards Satricum, to oppose the

                    heavy losses on both sides, was interrupted by a storm before victory had
                    inclined to either army. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    <name>The</name> Romans, not a whit discouraged by so indecisive a struggle,
                    prepared to do battle on the morrow; but the Volsci, when they reckoned up the
                    men they had lost in the fighting, were by no means so eager to incur the danger
                    a second time, and in the night marched off like beaten men <pb n="p.5"/> for
                    Antium, with fear and trembling, abandoning <note anchored="true"

                    <reg>being</reg> referred by Aemilius to the senate, they obtained an audience,
                    and giving over their air of arrogance, besought the Romans to grant them peace
                    and the right to war against the Sidicini. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    <name>These</name> requests, they said, were the more justifiable, inasmuch as
                    they had become friends of the Roman People when their state was flourishing and
                    not, like the Campanians, in their adversity; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    moreover, it was against the Sidicini that they were drawing the sword, a people
                    always their enemies and never friendly to the Romans, of whom they had never,
                    like the Samnites, sought friendship in time of peace, nor assistance, like the
                    Campanians, in time of war; neither were they under the protection of the Roman
                    People, nor yet their subjects. </p>

                    <name>Titus</name> Aemilius the praetor laid the petition of the Samnites before
                    the senate, and the Fathers voted to renew the treaty with them. <milestone

                    <name>The</name> praetor then replied to the ambassadors that the Roman People
                    had not been to blame for the interruption of the friendship, and that, since
                    the Samnites were themselves grown weary of a war contracted through <pb n="p.7"
                    /> their own fault, they had no objection to renewing <note anchored="true"

                        n="3" unit="section"/> as for the Sidicini, the Romans would not interfere
                    with the free judgment of the Samnite People regarding peace and war. <milestone

                    <reg>on</reg> the ratification of the treaty, the ambassadors went home, and the
                    Roman army was at once recalled, after receiving a year's pay and rations for
                    three months, which the consul had stipulated should be the price of a truce, to
                    last until the envoys should return. </p>

                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    <name>The</name> Samnites marched against the Sidicini with the same forces
                    which they had employed in the war with Rome, and were confidently hoping to
                    capture the city of their enemies in a little while, when the Sidicini attempted
                    to anticipate them by surrendering to the Romans. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/>
                    <reg>then</reg> , after the Fathers had rejected their offer, on the ground that
                    it came too late and had been wrung from them only by the direst necessity, they
                    carried it to the Latins, who had already risen in arms on their own account.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>even</reg> the Campanians —so much more vivid was their recollection of the
                    injury done them by the Samnites than of the kindness of the Romans —could not
                    refrain from joining in this expedition. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>one</reg> great army, gathered out of all these nations, invaded the
                    borders of the Samnites, under a Latin general, but wrought more havoc by
                    pillage than in battle; and although the Latins came off best in all encounters,
                    they were not unwilling to retire from the enemy's country, that they might not
                    have to fight so often. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    <name>The</name> Samnites thus had time to send ambassadors to Rome.
                        <reg>appearing</reg> before the senate, they complained that they were
                    suffering the same treatment as allies that they had experienced while enemies,
                    and besought the Romans, with the utmost humility, <pb n="p.9"/> that they
                        <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> would be satisfied to have snatched
                    from <note anchored="true" place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 341</note> the
                    grasp of the Samnites a victory over their Campanian and Sidicinian foes, and
                    not suffer them actually to be conquered by the most cowardly of nations.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>if</reg> the Latins and Campanians were subject to the Roman People, let
                    the Romans use their authority and keep them from invading Samnium; but if they
                    rejected that authority, let them hold them in check by force of arms.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>to</reg> this plea the Romans returned an ambiguous reply, since they were
                    loath to confess that the Latins were no longer under their control, and feared
                    to estrange them if they censured them. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    <name>The</name> Campanians, they said, were upon a different footing, having
                    come under their protection not by treaty but by surrender; accordingly the
                    Campanians, whether willing or not, should keep the peace; but there was nothing
                    in their treaty with the Latins which entitled them to prevent their going to
                    war with whom they chose. </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                    <reg>this</reg> answer, as it left the Samnites quite at <note anchored="true"
                        place="unspecified" type="margin">B.C. 340</note> a loss to forecast the
                    Roman policy, so it alienated the Campanians with fear, while it persuaded the
                    Latins that there was no longer any concession the Romans would not make them,
                    and rendered them yet more audacious. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>accordingly</reg> their leaders, under colour of forwarding the war against
                    the Samnites, appointed numerous councils, and in all their deliberations
                    secretly concocted war with Rome. <reg>in</reg> this war, too, the Campanians
                    took part, against their preservers. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>but</reg> though all their measures were sedulously concealed —for they
                    wished to shake off the Samnite foe behind them before the Romans should take
                    the alarm —yet through certain persons connected by private ties of hospitality
                    and kinship, <pb n="p.11"/> information of the conspiracy leaked out and was

                    brought to Rome. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    <name>The</name> consuls were commanded, before their time was up, to resign
                    their office, in order that new consuls might the sooner be chosen to confront
                    so momentous an invasion; but a scruple arose at allowing the election to be
                    held by those whose authority had been abridged, and so they had an interregnum.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    <reg>there</reg> were two interreges, Marcus Valerius and Marcus Fabius: the

                    <reg>it</reg> is believed to have been in this year that Alexander, king of
                    Epirus, sailed with a fleet to Italy —a war which, had it prospered in its
                    beginning, would doubtless have extended to the Romans. <note anchored="true"
