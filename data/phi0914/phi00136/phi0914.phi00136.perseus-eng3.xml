                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> On entering upon their office the new
                        consuls, P. Cornelius Scipio and Manius Acilius Glabrio, were instructed by
                        the <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> senate to make it their first
                        business before balloting for their provinces to sacrifice adult victims in
                        all the temples in which for the greater part of the year there was a
                        lectisternium and to offer up special prayers that the intention of the
                        senate to undertake a fresh war might bring prosperity and happiness to the
                        senate and people of Rome. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> All these
                        sacrifices were performed without anything untoward occurring, and in the
                        victims which were first offered the omens were entirely favourable. The
                        haruspices accordingly assured the consuls that the boundaries of Rome would
                        be extended by this war and that everything pointed to victory and triumph.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When this report was laid before the
                        senate their minds were at rest so far as the sanctions of religion
                            <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> were concerned and they ordered the
                        question to be submitted to the people, "Whether it was their will and
                        intention that war should be undertaken against Antiochus and those who were
                        of his party?" <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> If this proposal were
                        carried, the consuls, if they thought fit, were to bring the matter afresh
                        before the senate. P. Cornelius put the question to the people, and it was
                        carried; the senate then decreed that the consuls should ballot for the
                        provinces of Greece and Italy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The one to
                        whom Greece was allotted was to take over the army which by order of the
                        senate L. Quinctius had raised from Roman citizens and allies for service in
                        that province, and in addition the army which M. Baebius had with the
                        authority of the senate taken to Macedonia. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /> He was also commissioned to take up reinforcements of not more than 5000
                        men from the allies outside Italy. It was further decided that L. Quinctius
                        should be appointed second in command for this war. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> The other consul to whom Italy was allotted was
                        instructed to conduct operations against the Boii with whichever army he
                        preferred of the two which the late consuls had, and to send the other to
                        Rome to form the City legions and be ready to go wherever the senate thought
                        fit. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="2" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Such were the decrees made by the senate
                        up to the actual allocation of the provinces. Then at last the consuls
                        balloted, and Greece fell to Acilius, Italy to Cornelius. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> When this was settled a senatus consultum was passed in
                        the following terms: "Whereas the Roman people have at this time ordered
                        that there be war with Antiochus and with all who are under his rule, the
                        consuls shall on this behalf issue orders for a public intercession and M.
                        Acilius shall vow Great Games to Jupiter and gifts and offerings to all the
                        shrines.'' <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> This vow was made by the consul
                        in the following formula, as dictated by P. Licinius the Pontifex Maximus:
                        "If the war which the people has ordered to be taken in hand against King
                        Antiochus be brought to such a close as the senate and people <milestone
                            n="4??" unit="section"/> of Rome desire, then all the Roman people shall
                        celebrate in thy honour, Jupiter, Great Games for the space of ten days, and
                        oblations of money shall be made to all thy shrines in such wise as the
                        senate shall decree. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Whatsoever magistrate
                        shall hold these Games, whensoever and wheresoever he shall celebrate them,
                        may they be deemed to be duly and rightly celebrated and the oblations duly
                        and rightly offered!" <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Then the consul
                        proclaimed special intercessions to be offered for two days. After the
                        balloting for the consular provinces the praetors drew for theirs. M. Junius
                        Brutus obtained the two civil jurisdictions; Bruttium fell to A. Cornelius
                        Mammula; Sicily to M. Aemilius Lepidus; Sardinia to L. Oppius Salinator; the
                        command of the fleet to C. Livius Salinator; and Further Spain to L.
                        Aemilius Paullus. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The distribution of the armies amongst
                        them was as follows: The new levies which had been raised by L. Quinctius
                        the preceding year were assigned to A. Cornelius, and his duty was to
                        protect the whole of the coast round Tarentum and Brundisium. <milestone
                            n="8" unit="section"/> It was decreed that L. Aemilius Paullus should
                        take over the army which M. Fulvius had commanded as proconsul the year
                        before and also raise 3000 fresh infantry and 300 cavalry for service in
                        Further Spain, two-thirds to consist of allied troops, the remainder being
                        Romans. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> A reinforcement of the same
                        strength was sent to C. Flaminius, who was continued in his command in
                        Hither Spain. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> M. Aemilius Lepidus was
                        ordered to take over the province and army of Sicily from <milestone
                            n="11??" unit="section"/> L. Valerius, whom he was to succeed, and if it
                        seemed advisable he was to retain him as propraetor and divide the province
                        with him; one section was to extend from Agrigentum to Pachynum, the other
                        from Pachynum to Tyndareum. L. Valerius was also to guard the latter coast
                        with twenty ships of war. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Lepidus was
                        further commissioned to requisition two-tenths of all the corn in the island
                        and have it conveyed to Greece. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> L. Oppius
                        was ordered to make the same requisition in Sardinia, the corn, however, was
                        not to be sent to Greece but to Rome. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> C.
                        Livius, the praetor who was to command the fleet, received instructions to
                        sail to Greece with twenty vessels which had completed their armament and
                        take over the ships which Atilius had commanded. <milestone n="15"
                            unit="section"/> The repairing and fitting out of the ships in the
                        dockyards was placed in the hands of M. Junius, and he was to select the
                        crews of these vessels from freedmen. </p>
                </div>
                <div part="N" sample="complete" org="uniform" n="3" type="chapter">
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Six commissioners were sent to Africa to
                        procure corn for Greece, the cost to be borne by Rome; three went to
                        Carthage and three to Numidia. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> So
                        determined were the citizens to be in perfect readiness for the war that the
                        consul published an edict forbidding anyone who was a senator or had the
                        right of speaking in the senate, or held office as an inferior magistrate,
                        from leaving Rome for any place from which he could not return in a day.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> It was also forbidden for five
                        senators to be absent from the City at any one time. Whilst C. Livius was
                        doing his utmost to make the fleet ready for sea he was for some time
                        delayed by a dispute with the citizens of the maritime colonies. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> When they were impressed for the fleet they
                        appealed to the tribunes of the plebs, who referred them to the senate.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The senate unanimously decreed that
                        there was no exemption from service for the colonists. The colonies
                        concerned were Ostia, Fregenae, Castrum Novum, Pyrgi, Antium, Tarracina,
                        Minturnae and Sinuessa. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The consul
                        Acilius, in compliance with a resolution of the senate, submitted two
                        questions to the College of Fetials. One was whether the declaration of war
                        had to be made to Antiochus personally, or whether it would be sufficient to
                        announce it at one of his frontier garrisons. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> The other was whether a separate declaration of war
                        must be made to the Aetolians and whether in that case the league of amity
                        and alliance must first be denounced. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        Fetials replied that they had already on a previous occasion, when they were
                        consulted in the case of Philip, decided that it was a matter of
                        indifference whether the declaration were made personally or in one of his
                        garrison towns. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As to the league of amity,

                        Antiochus, who was at Chalcis, was not idle during the winter. Some of the
                        Greek communities he endeavoured to win over by despatching embassies to
                        them, others sent embassies spontaneously to him, as for instance the
                        Epirots, in accordance with the general determination of their people, and
                        also the Eleans from the Peloponnese. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                        Eleans sought his assistance against the Achaeans, who having declared war
                        on Antiochus against their wish would, they expected, attack them first of
                        all. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> A detachment of infantry 1000 strong
                        was sent to them under the command of Euphanes, a Cretan. The deputation
                        from Epirus showed a by no means honest and straightforward spirit to either
                        side; they wanted to ingratiate themselves with Antiochus, but at the same
                        time to give no offence to the Romans. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        They asked the king not to involve them in the war hastily, for from their
                        position on the front of Greece facing Italy they would have to meet the
                        first onslaught of the Romans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But if he
                        could protect Epirus with his fleet and army all the Epirots would eagerly
                        welcome him in their cities and harbours; if he was unable to do so, they
                        begged him not to expose them unprotected and defenceless to the hostility
                        of Rome. Their object was perfectly clear. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        If, as they were inclined to believe, he kept clear of Epirus, all would be
                        safe so far as the Roman armies were concerned, whilst they would have
                        secured the king's good graces by expressing their readiness to receive him,
                        had he gone to them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> If on the other hand
                        he entered Epirus, they hoped that the Romans would pardon them for yielding
                        to the superior strength of one who was on the spot, without waiting for
                        succour from a distance. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> As Antiochus was
                        at a loss what reply to make to this ambiguous plea, he said he would send
                        envoys to them to discuss the matters which concerned him and them alike.

                        public and private life, and many were in a condition which could not
                        possibly long continue without a revolutionary change. The leading Boeotians
                        from all parts of the country assembled at Thebes, and thither Antiochus
                        went to meet them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> In spite of the fact
                        that by his attack on the Roman detachments at Delium and Chalcis he had
                        committed hostile acts which were neither trifling nor such as could be
                        explained away, he took the same line in addressing the Boeotian council
                        that he had taken at his first conference at Chalcis and had instructed his
                        envoys to take in the council of the Achaeans. <milestone n="4"

                        was deceived as to what he really meant; however, a resolution veiled in
                        inoffensive terms was passed in support of the king and in opposition to
                        Rome. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Having thus secured the nation he

                        can doubt that these people who have no strength of their own and always
                        cringe before a power which is present to their eyes will display the same
                        craven spirit which marks the proceedings of their councils in suing for
                        pardon, and as soon as they see a Roman army in Greece will turn to their
                        accustomed obedience? <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Nor will they be

                        secure the adhesion of Philip than of these people! For if he once takes up
                        the cause he will have everything at stake, and he will contribute an amount
                        of strength which will not only be an accession to us in a war with Rome,
                        but was not long ago sufficient of itself to withstand the Romans.

                        reasons which your envoy Thoas gave for inducing Antiochus to come to

                        complaining and chafing under the servile conditions imposed upon him in the
                        guise of peace. He used to compare the king's rage to that of some animal

                        let us at all events see to it that if we cannot get him on our side the

                        easily turn Philip aside from actively assisting the Romans to the defence

                        Philip himself suggested this to Antiochus as a means of making himself
                        popular with the Macedonians and stirring up ill-will against their king for
                        having left his soldiers unburied, or else Antiochus, with the vanity
                        natural to kings, formed this in his own mind, a project apparently of

                        simultaneous attack on all sides; he quite saw, what indeed was
                        indisputable, that it depended upon the fate of the first city which he
                        attacked whether he would be held in contempt or in dread throughout the

                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> His next objective was Larisa, where
                        he expected that either the dread of meeting the fate of the other towns
                        taken by storm or gratitude for his free dismissal of their garrison or the
                        example of so many cities voluntarily surrendering would dissuade them from

                        3000 infantry and 200 cavalry took Malloea and Cyretiae by storm and ravaged

                        were in favour of an immediate assault as the city was situated in a plain
                        open on all sides to an approach over level ground, and they urged that
                        there should be no delay in constructing siege works and bringing up
                        artillery to attack the walls on all sides simultaneously. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Others reminded the council that there was no

                        unsuitable for warlike operations, most of all so for investing and
                        assaulting a city. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> While the king was
                        uncertain as to whether there was most to be hoped or feared from the
                        attempt, delegates from Pharsalus arrived to tender the submission of their
                        city and this raised his spirits. M. Baebius had in the meanwhile met Philip
                        at Dassaretiae and they both agreed that Ap. Claudius should be sent to

                        Macedonia by forced marches and gained the summit of the ridge which looks
                        down on Gonni, a place twenty miles distant from Larisa at the head of the
                        Vale of Tempe. Here he marked out a camp of greater extent than the force
                        with him required, and kindled more numerous fires than were needed in order
                        to give the enemy the impression that the entire Roman army was there
                        together with Philip. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Antiochus withdrew
                        from Larisa the very next day and returned to Demetrias, alleging the
                        approach of winter as the reason for his retreat. The Aetolians and the
                        Athamanians also retired within their own frontiers. Although Appius saw
                        that the purpose of his march, the raising of the siege, was effected he
                        nevertheless went on to Larisa to reassure his allies as to the future.

                        after numerous communications to her father followed by personal interviews
                        (for he was reluctant to be entangled in an alliance so far above his own

                        wedding was celebrated as though it were a time of peace, and forgetting the

                        see that the men had passed the winter under no stricter discipline than
                        their leader. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> From Chaeronea he ordered

                        was trying to persuade his people to take the king's side. He had succeeded
                        in bringing Clytus, in whom the supreme power was vested at the time, over
                        to his views, but he saw that there would be difficulty in inducing

                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At a meeting of the council he told

                        instead of intimidating them it only put them more on their guard.

                        official authority, were alike powerless against those who declined to

                        is intersected by the Apennines. To the north of the pass are situated
                        Epirus, Perrhaebia, Magnesia, Thessaly, the Achaeans of Phthiotis, and the
                        Maliac Gulf. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> South of it lie the greater

                        Euboea, and Attica, which projects into the sea like a promontory; beyond
                        these is the Peloponnese. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This range
                        extends from Leucas on the western sea through Aetolia to the eastern sea,
                        and is so rugged and precipitous that even light infantry-let alone an
                        army-would have great difficulty in finding any paths by which to cross it.
                        The eastern end of the range is called Oeta, and its highest peak bears the
                        name of Callidromus. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The road running

                        sent two detachments out of the 4000 Aetolians who had joined him, one to
                        hold Heraclea, a place just in front of the pass, the other to Hypata.

                        and then that of Heraclea; in neither place did the Aetolians prove of the

                        sent a message to the Aetolians at Heraclea asking them to do him this
                        service at least in the war, namely, to seize and hold the crests of the

                        the receipt of this message there was a sharp difference of opinion among
                        the Aetolians. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Some thought that they
                        ought to comply with the king's request and go; others were in favour of
                        remaining in their quarters at Heraclea, prepared for either eventuality.

                        the consul hung out the signal for battle and formed his line on a narrow

                        across the whole length of the rampart. To the left of them were posted a

                        mountains, so that they might from their higher ground harass the

                        beyond down to the sea is impassable owing to bogs and quicksands, he posted
                        the elephants with their usual guard, and behind them the cavalry, and a

                        to break through, and they received considerable assistance from those on
                        the higher ground, who discharged bullets from their slings, arrows and

                        was made in greater force they gradually fell back to their rampart, and
                        standing upon it made practically a second rampart with their levelled
                        spears. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The rampart, owing to its moderate
                        height, not only offered a higher position from which to fight, but also

                        and impossible for the cavalry; the frightened horses created more confusion
                        than in the actual battle. The plunder of the camp still further delayed the

                        L. Cornelius Scipio had been sent on by the consul some days previously, and
                        on his arrival found that Cato had outstripped him. <milestone n="8"

                        Assembly, where they gave the same details of the Aetolian campaign as had
                        been given to the senate. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> A decree was
                        made that there should be thanksgivings for three days, and the praetor was

                        delivering up Heraclea and begging pardon of the senate for their madness

                        from their duty, they did not aggravate their fault by willful obstinacy,

                        the war-even for them there was still the possibility, if they showed true
                        repentance, of remaining unharmed. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> To this
                        message they returned a defiant answer; the question would evidently have to
                        be decided by arms, and though the king was overcome, the war with the
                        Aetolians was clearly only just beginning. The consul accordingly moved his
                        army from Thermopylae to Heraclea, and on the very same day he rode round
                        the entire circuit of the walls to ascertain the situation of the city.

                        where the houses were almost closer together than in the city itself, he
                        gave the direction of the assault to Tiberius Sempronius Longus. <milestone

                        he posted Appius Claudius. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Through the

                        the walls were battered by the rams they did not, as is usual, turn aside
                        the blows by using looped ropes, but they made sorties in considerable
                        strength and some carried firebrands to throw on the siege works. <milestone

                        and when they built up the wall where it had been destroyed they left more

                            unit="section"/> In the early days of the siege while their strength was
                        unimpaired these sallies were frequent and powerful, but as time went on
                        they became fewer and feebler. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Amidst the
                        many difficulties they had to contend with nothing wore them down so much as
                        want of sleep. The Romans owing to their numbers were able to arrange
                        regular reliefs for their men, but the Aetolians were comparatively few, and
                        the same men having to be on duty night and day they were completely
                        exhausted by the incessant strain. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For
                        four-and-twenty days, without a moment's respite day or night, they had to
                        sustain the attack of the enemy, who were delivering their assaults from
                        four different quarters at once. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                        Considering the time during which the attack had been going on, and in view
                        of the information brought by deserters, the consul felt pretty sure that
                        the Aetolians were at last worn out, and he formed the following plan.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When it was midnight he gave the
                        signal to retire and called off all the soldiers from the assault. He kept

                        until midnight, when it was again suspended till the third hour of the

                        that the cause of the assault not being kept up was the same as that which
                        was acting upon them, namely excessive fatigue, and when the signal for
                        retiring was given to the Romans, they too, as though it recalled them also,
                        quitted their posts and did not resume duty on the walls till the third hour

                        side he ordered Tiberius Sempronius to keep his soldiers on the alert and
                        ready for the signal, as he felt no doubt that the Aetolians would in the
                        nocturnal confusion rush to the places from which the battle-shout arose.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Some of the Aetolians were asleep,
                        worn out by toil and want of rest, and only roused themselves with great
                        difficulty; those who were still awake, hearing the noise of battle, ran
                        towards it through the darkness. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                        assailants were trying to climb over the fallen parts of the wall into the
                        city, others were endeavouring to mount the walls by scaling ladders, and
                        the Aetolians were hurrying up from all parts to meet the attack. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> The one quarter where the suburban buildings
                        stood was so far neither attacked nor guarded, but those who were to attack
                        it were eagerly awaiting the signal and none were there to defend it.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> It was already dawn when the consul
                        gave the signal and they penetrated into the city without any opposition,
                        some over the ruined walls, others, where the walls were intact, by means of
                        scaling ladders. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As soon as the shouting
                        was heard which announced that the city was captured the Aetolians left
                        their posts and fled to the citadel. </p>
                    <p> The consul gave his victorious troops leave to sack the city, not as an act
                        of vengeance, but in order that the soldiery who had been forbidden this in
                        so many captured cities might in one place at least taste the fruits of
                        victory. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> About midday he recalled his men
                        and formed them into two divisions. One he ordered to march round the foot
                        of the mountain to a peak which was the same height as that on which the
                        citadel stood and separated from it by a ravine as though torn away from it.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The twin peaks were so near one
                        another that missiles could be thrown from the rock on to the citadel. With
                        the other division the consul intended to mount up to the citadel, and he
                        waited in the city for the signal from those who were to surmount the peak.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Their cheers on occupying the height
                        and the attack of the other division from the city were too much for the
                        Aetolians, utterly broken as their courage was and with no preparation for
                        standing a siege in the citadel, which could hardly contain, much less
                        protect, the women and children and the other non-combatants who had crowded
                        there. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> So at the first assault they laid
                        down their arms and surrendered. Amongst them was Damocritus, the first
                        magistrate of Aetolia. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> At the beginning
                        of the war he had told T. Quinctius, on his request for a copy of the decree
                        inviting Antiochus, that be would give it him in Italy when the Aetolians
                        were encamped there. This piece of arrogance made his surrender all the more

                        congratulations on the victory and at the same time to excuse himself on the

                        Then the two commanders separated to carry on the siege of the two places
                        simultaneously. These are about seven miles distant from each other, and as
                        Lamia stands on rising ground and looks towards Mount Oeta the distance
                        between them seems very short and all that goes on in the one place can be
                        seen from the other. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The Romans and the
                        Macedonians were strenuously engaged as though in mutual rivalry in siege
                        operations or in actual fighting night and day. But the Macedonians had the
                        more difficult task owing to the fact that the Roman galleries and vineae
                        and all their siege engines were above ground while the Macedonians
                        conducted the attack by means of subterranean mines, and in difficult places
                        they often came to rock upon which iron tools could make no impression.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Finding that he was making little
                        progress, the king held conferences with the leading men of the place in the

                            unit="section"/> He felt quite certain that if Heraclea were taken first

                        would win their gratitude for having raised the siege. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> His surmise proved correct, for no sooner was Heraclea
                        taken than a message reached him requesting him to abandon the siege, for as
                        it was the Romans who had fought the engagement with the Aetolians it was

                        be attended to first. He then granted them a ten days' armistice and
                        directed them to return to Hypata accompanied by L. Valerius Flaccus, to
                        whom they were to refer the questions they had intended to discuss with him,
                        and any other matters which they wished to discuss. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> On his arrival at Hypata, Flaccus found the Aetolian
                        leaders assembled in council and deliberating as to what line they should
                        take in negotiating with the consul. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They
                        were preparing to begin by alleging the old-standing treaty-rights and their
                        service to Rome, when Flaccus bade them desist from appealing to treaties
                        which they had themselves violated and broken. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> They would gain much more, he told them, by confessing
                        their misdoings and simply asking for mercy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"
                        /> Their only hope of safety lay not in the strength of their case but in
                        the clemency of the Roman people, and if they adopted a suppliant attitude
                        he would stand by them before the consul and in the senate at Rome, for they
                        would have to send their delegates there also. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> All those present saw that only one path led to safety,
                        namely their formal submission to Rome. They believed that their appearance
                        as suppliants would give them an inviolable character in Roman eyes, and
                        they would still preserve their independence should Fortune hold out any
                        better prospect. </p>

                        that it is because you do not know us that you lay upon us commands which

                        To this the consul retorted: "No, I do not trouble myself much as to what

                        cowed, they at last realised their position, and he said that he and the
                        Aetolians with him quite saw that they must carry out the consul's commands,
                        but it was necessary that a decree to that effect should be made at a
                        meeting of the national council. In order that this might be done he asked
                        for a ten days' armistice. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Flaccus
                        supported the request, which was granted, and they returned to Hypata. Here
                        Phaeneas reported to the inner council-known as the Apokleti-the commands
                        laid upon them and the fate which had all but overtaken him and his

                        Philip asked him if he wished him to recover the cities which had renounced
                        their alliance with Rome. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> On receiving the
                        consul's consent he marched his army to Demetrias, as he was fully aware of
                        the confusion which prevailed there. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The
                        citizens were in despair, they saw themselves deserted by Antiochus, with no
                        prospect of help from the Aetolians, and were daily expecting the arrival of
                        their enemy Philip, or of a more relentless enemy still, the Romans, who had
                        more reason to be angry with them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> There
                        was in the city a disorganised body of Antiochus' soldiers, the small force
                        which had been left to hold the city, joined afterwards by the fugitives
                        from the battle, who came in, most of them, without arms. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> They had neither the strength nor the resolution to
                        stand a siege, and when emissaries from Philip held out to them hopes of
                        obtaining pardon they sent to him to say that the gates were open to the
                        king. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Some of the principal men left the
                        city as he entered it; Eurylochus committed suicide. In accordance with the
                        stipulation, the soldiers of Antiochus were sent through Macedonia and
                        Thrace to Lysimachia under the protection of a Macedonian escort. <milestone

                        would probably have brought ruin on the Aetolians as a nation. Quinctius had

                            unit="section"/> he had not forgotten that they were the only people

                        liberating Greece and had refused to be guided by him when he sought to
                        dissuade them from their mad project by forewarning them as to what would
                        happen to them, a forewarning which events had just now proved to be true.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As, however, he looked upon himself as
                        especially bound to see that no State in the Greece which he had freed was
                        utterly destroyed, he decided to walk up to the walls so that the Aetolians
                        could easily see who he was. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He was at

                        throughout the city and troops that Quinctius was there. There was a general
                        rush to the walls; the people all held out their hands in supplication, and
                        with one voice appealed to him by name and implored him to come to their
                        succour and save them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He was deeply moved
                        by this appeal, but at the same time he made signs to them that it was not
                        in his power to help them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> When he saw the
                        consul he said to him, "M. Acilius, do you fail to see what is going on, or
                        if you are quite aware of it do you consider that it in no way touches the
                        supreme interest of the Republic?" <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        consul's attention was aroused and he replied, "Why are you not explicit?
                        What do you mean?" Quinctius continued, "Do you not see, now that Antiochus
                        is crushed, how you are wasting time in laying siege to a couple of cities
                        when your year of office has almost expired, while Philip, who has never
                        seen the standards or the battle-line of the enemy, has been annexing not
                        cities only, but all those States, Athamania, Perrhaebia, Aperantia,
                        Dolopia? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And yet it is not so important to
                        us that the strength and resources of the Aetolians should be weakened as it
                        is that Philip should not be allowed to extend his dominions indefinitely

                        somewhat humiliating to abandon the siege without accomplishing anything.
                        Finally the matter was left for Quinctius to settle. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> He went back to that section of the walls from which
                        the Aetolians had been calling out to him. They were still there and began
                        to implore him still more earnestly to take pity on the nation of the
                        Aetolians. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> On this he told some of them to
                        come out to him; Phaeneas and others of their leaders at once went out. As

                        destined to be the nursing father of Greece, I shall not desist from showing

                        before the consul as your advocate and intercessor." <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> They followed his advice and the consul was not deaf to
                        their appeal; an armistice was granted until the result of the mission to
                        Rome was known; the siege was raised and the army sent into Phocis.

                        went to Aegium to attend a meeting of the Achaean council. The subjects of

                        act of grace, and the Eleans wished their incorporation into the league to
                        be spontaneous on their part rather than that it should be effected through
                        the Romans. </p>

                        troops it was alleged that they had given him pecuniary assistance and they
                        made no attempt to deny that they had opened negotiations with him.

                        continue on the old friendly footing was met by the consul with the remark
                        that he did not know whether he was to regard them as friends or as foes.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The senate would decide that; he
                        referred their whole cause to Rome, and for that purpose he granted them an

                        appeared before the senate they were more concerned to mention acts of
                        hostility which they had not committed than to clear themselves from the

                        reply they received was such as to make them understand that they had
                        obtained pardon rather than proved their innocence. Just before this a
                        deputation from Philip was introduced into the senate to present his
                        congratulations upon the recent victory and to request to be allowed to

                        Not only was this gracious reception accorded to them, but Philip's son
                        Demetrius, who was living in Rome as a hostage, was placed in their hands to
                        be taken back to his father. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Such was the

                        he must lose his own throne. The king realised that Hannibal was the only

                        Delos for some days by northerly winds; when these subsided they put out
                        from Delos and steered for the harbour of Phanae, at the southern end of
                        Chios, facing the Aegean. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> They then
                        brought their ships up to the city, and after taking in supplies sailed to
                        Phocaea. Eumenes, who had gone to his fleet at Elea, returned in a few days
                        with twenty-four decked ships and a larger number of open ones, and sailed
                        on to Phocaea, where he found the Romans getting their ships ready and
                        making every preparation for the coming naval contest. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> From Phocaea they put to sea with one hundred and five
                        decked ships and about fifty open ones. At first they were driven towards
                        the land by the northerly winds which blew across their course and were
                        forced to sail in almost a single line; when the wind became less violent
                        they endeavoured to make the harbour of Corycus, which lies beyond Cissus.

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When news was brought to Polyxenidas of
                        the approach of the Roman fleet he was delighted at the prospect of a fight.
                        Extending his left towards the open sea he ordered the captains of the right
                        division to align their ships towards the land, and in this way he advanced
                        to battle with a straight front. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> On seeing
                        this the Roman commander took in sail, lowered his masts, and stowing away
                        the tackle waited for the ships in the rear to come up. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> His front line now consisted of thirty ships, and in
                        order to make it extend as far as the enemy's left he directed these vessels
                        to set up their foresails and steer for the open sea; <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> those behind, as they came up, were ordered to direct
                        their course landward against the enemy's right. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> Eumenes was bringing up the rear, but as soon as he saw
                        the hurried removal of the masts and rigging he urged his ships on with all
                        possible speed. Full in view of both fleets were two Carthaginian vessels
                        which outstripped the Roman fleet and three of the king's ships went to meet
                        them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The inequality of numbers enabled
                        two of these to close on one of the Carthaginian vessels, and after shearing
                        off both banks of oars they boarded it and flinging overboard or killing the
                        defenders captured the ship. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The other
                        Carthaginian ship which had only one opponent, seeing its sister-ship
                        captured, fled back to the Roman fleet before the three could make a
                        simultaneous attack upon it. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Livius was
                        furious and made straight in his flagship for the enemy, and as the two
                        vessels which had overpowered the single Carthaginian ship bore down upon
                        him, expecting the same success, he ordered the rowers to back water on both
                        sides so that the way of the ship might be stopped. Then he ordered them to
                        hook their grappling irons on to the enemy ships and when they had made a
                        soldiers' battle of it to remember that they were Romans and not to look
                        upon the slaves of Antiochus as men. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This
                        one ship now defeated and captured the two much more easily than the two had
                        captured the single one previously. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> By
                        this time the fleets were engaged along the whole line and as the fighting
                        went on the ships became everywhere intermixed. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> Eumenes, who had come up after the battle had commenced
                        seeing that Livius had thrown the enemy's left into confusion, attacked the
                        right division where the struggle was still an equal one. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> It was not long before the enemy's left
                        division took to flight, for when Polyxenidas saw that he was clearly
                        worsted as far as the courage of his soldiers was concerned he lowered his
                        foresails and fled away in disorder, and those who had been engaged with
                        Eumenes near the land very soon did the same. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> As long as the rowers could hold out and there was any
                        chance of harassing the hindmost ships Eumenes and the Romans kept up a
                        vigorous pursuit. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But when they found that
                        owing to the speed of the enemy's ships, which were light as compared with
                        theirs, loaded as they were with supplies, their attempt to overtake them
                        was baffled, they desisted from the pursuit, after capturing thirteen
                        vessels with their troops and crews and sinking ten. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The only vessel lost in the Roman fleet was the
                        Carthaginian vessel, overpowered by the two assailants at the beginning of
                        the battle. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Polyxenidas did not stop his
                        flight till he was in the harbour of Ephesus. The Romans remained for that
                        day at Cissus, from which place the king's fleet had gone out to battle; the
                        next day they continued to follow up the enemy. Midway on their course they
                        were met by twenty-five decked ships from Rhodes under the command of
                        Pausistratus. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> With their united fleets
                        they still followed up the enemy and appeared in line of battle before the
                        entrance of the harbour. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After they had
                        thus forced the enemy to admit his defeat, the Rhodians and Eumenes were
                        sent home and the Romans started for Chios. They sailed past Phocaea, one of
                        the Erythraean ports, and then anchored for the night. The next day they
                        sailed up to the city itself. Here they stayed for a few days mainly to
                        recruit the crews and then they proceeded to Phocaea. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Here four quinqueremes were left to guard the city and
                        the fleet went on to Canae, where as the winter was approaching the ships
                        were drawn up on land and protected by a ring of entrenchments. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> At the close of the year the elections were held.
                        The new consuls were L. Cornelius Scipio and C. Laelius, and all were
                        looking upon Africanus to end the war with Antiochus. The praetors elected
                        on the following day were M. Tuccius, L. Aurunculeius, Cn. Fulvius, L.
                        Aemilius, P. Junius and C. Atinius Labeo. </p>
