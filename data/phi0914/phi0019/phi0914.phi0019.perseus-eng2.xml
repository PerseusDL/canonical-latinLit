                    <p> Titus Veturius and Spurius Postumius, with their army, surrounded by the
                        Samnites at the Caudine forks; enter into a treaty, give six hundred
                        hostages, and are sent under the yoke. The treaty declared invalid; the two
                        generals and the other sureties sent back to the Samnites, but are not
                        accepted. Not long after, Papirius Cursor obliterates this disgrace, by
                        vanquishing the Samnites, sending them under the yoke, and recover- ing the
                        hostages. Two tribes added. Appius Claudius, censor, con- structs the
                        Claudian aqueduct, and the Appian road; admits the sons of freedom into the
                        senate. Successes against the Apulians, Etruscans, Umbrians, Marsians,
                        Pelignians, Aequans, and Samnites. Mention made of Alexander the Great, who
                        flourished at this time; a compara- tive estimate of his strength, and that
                        of the Roman people, tending to show, that if he had carried his arms into
                        Italy, he would not have been as successful there as he had been in the
                        Eastern countries. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> THIS year is followed by the convention of
                    Caudium, so memorable on account of the misfortune of the Romans, the consuls
                    being Titus Veturius Calvinus and Spurius Postumius. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> The Samnites had as their commander that year Caius
                    Pontius, son to Herennius, born of a father most highly renowned for wisdom, and
                    himself a consummate warrior and commander. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    When the ambassadors, who had been sent to make restitution, returned, without
                    concluding a peace, he said, <quote> That ye may not think that no purpose has
                        been effected by this embassy, whatever degree of anger the deities of
                        heaven had conceived against us, on account of the infraction of the <pb
                            n="560" xml:id="p.560"/> treaty, has been hereby expiated. <milestone
                            n="4" unit="section"/> I am very confident, that whatever deities they
                        were, whose will it was that you should be reduced to the necessity of
                        making the restitution, which had been demanded according to the treaty, it
                        was not agreeable to them, that our atonement for the breach of treaty
                        should be so haughtily spurned by the Romans. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> For what more could possibly be done towards appeasing
                        the gods, and softening the anger of men, than we have done? <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> The effects of the enemy, taken among the spoils,
                        which appeared to be our own by the right of war, we restored: the authors
                        of the war, as we could not deliver them up alive, we delivered to them
                        dead: their goods we carried to Rome, lest by retaining them, any degree of
                        guilt should remain among us. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> What more,
                        Roman, do I owe to thee? what to the treaty? what to the gods, the
                        guarantees of the treaty? What umpire shall I call in to judge of your
                        resentment, and of my punishment? I decline none; neither nation nor private
                        person. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But if nothing in human law is
                        left to the weak against a stronger, I will appeal to the gods, the avengers
                        of intolerable arrogance, and will beseech them to turn their wrath against
                        those for whom neither the restoration of their own effects, nor additional
                        heaps of other men's property, can suffice; <milestone n="9" unit="section"
                        /> whose cruelty is not satiated by the death of the guilty, by the
                        surrender of their lifeless bodies, nor by their goods accompanying the
                        surrender of the owner; who cannot be appeased otherwise than by giving them
                        our blood to drink, and our entrails to be torn. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Samnites, war is just to those for whom it is
                        necessary, and arms are clear of impiety for those who have no hope left but
                        in arms. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Wherefore, as in every human
                        undertaking, it is of the utmost importance what matter men may set about
                        with the favour, what under the displeasure of the gods, be assured that the
                        former wars ye waged in opposition to the gods more than to men; in this,
                        which is now impending, ye will act under the immediate guidance of the gods
                        themselves. </quote>
                </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> After uttering these predictions, not more
                    cheering than true, he led out the troops, and placed his camp about Caudium, as
                    much out of view as possible. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> From thence he
                    sent to Calatia, where he heard that the Roman consuls were encamped, ten
                    soldiers, in the habit of shepherds, and ordered them to keep some cattle
                    feeding in several different places, at a small <pb n="561" xml:id="p.561"/>
                    distance from the Roman posts; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and that, when
                    they fell in with any of their foragers, they should all agree in the same
                    story, that the legions of the Samnites were then in Apulia, that they were
                    besieging Luceria with their whole force, and very near taking it by storm.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Such a rumour had been industriously
                    spread before, and had already reached the Romans; but these prisoners increased
                    the credit of it, especially as they all concurred in the same report.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There was no doubt but that the Romans
                    would carry succour to the Lucerians, as being good and faithful allies; and for
                    this further reason, lest all Apulia, through apprehension of the impending
                    danger, might go over to the enemy. The only point of deliberation was, by what
                    road they should go. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There were two roads
                    leading to Luceria, one along the coast of the upper sea, wide and open; but, as
                    it was the safer, so it was proportionably longer: the other, which was shorter,
                    through the Caudine forks. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The nature of the
                    place is this: there are two deep glens, narrow and covered with wood, connected
                    together by mountains ranging on both sides from one to the other; between these
                    lies a plain of considerable extent, enclosed in the middle, abounding in grass
                    and water, and through the middle of which the passage runs: <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> but before you can arrive at it, the first defile must be
                    passed, while the only way back is through the road by which you entered it; or
                    if in case of resolving to proceed forward, you must go by the other glen, which
                    is still more narrow and difficult. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Into this
                    plain the Romans, having marched down their troops by one of those passes
                    through the cleft of a rock, when they advanced onward to the other defile,
                    found it blocked up by trees thrown across, and a mound of huge stones lying in
                    their way. When the stratagem of the enemy now became apparent, there is seen at
                    the same time a body of troops on the eminence over the glen. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Hastening back, then, they proceed to retrace the road by
                    which they had entered; they found that also shut up by such another fence, and
                    men in arms. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Then, without orders, they
                    halted; amazement took possession of their minds, and a strange kind of numbness
                    seized their limbs: they then remained a long time motionless and silent, each
                    looking to the other, as if each thought the other more capable of judging and
                    advising than himself. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> After some time, when
                    they saw that the consul's pavilions were being erected, and that some <pb
                        n="562" xml:id="p.562"/> were getting ready the implements for throwing up
                    works, although they were sensible that it must appear ridiculous, the attempt
                    to raise a fortification in their present desperate condition, <milestone
                        n="13??" unit="section"/> and when almost every hope was lost, would be an
                    object of necessity, yet, not to add a fault to their misfortunes, they all,
                    without being advised or ordered by any one, set <milestone n="14??"
                        unit="section"/> earnestly to work, and enclosed a camp with a rampart,
                    close to the water, while themselves, besides that the enemy heaped insolent
                    taunts on them, seemed with melancholy to acknowledge the apparent fruitlessness
                    of their toil and labour. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The
                    lieutenants-general and tribunes, without being summoned to consultation, (for
                    there was no room for either consultation or remedy,) assembled round the
                    dejected consul; while the soldiers, crowding to the general's quarters,
                    demanded from their leaders that succour, which it was hardly in the power of
                    the immortal gods themselves to afford them. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Night came on them while lamenting their
                    situation, rather than consulting, whilst they urged expedients, each according
                    to his temper; one crying out, <quote>Let us go over those fences of the
                        roads;</quote> others, <quote> over the steeps; through the woods; any way,
                        where arms can be carried. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Let us be but
                        permitted to come to the enemy, whom we have been used to conquer now near
                        thirty years. All places will be level and plain to a Roman, fighting
                        against the perfidious Samnite. </quote>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Another would say, <quote> Whither, or by what
                        way can we go? Do we expect to remove the mountains from their foundations?
                        While these cliffs hang over us, by what road will you reach the enemy?
                        Whether armed or unarmed, brave or dastardly, we are all, without
                        distinction, captured and vanquished. The enemy will not even show us a
                        weapon, by which we might die with honour. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        He will finish the war, without moving from his seat. </quote> In such
                    discourse, thinking of neither food nor rest, the night was passed. Nor could
                    the Samnites, though in circumstances so joyous, instantly determine how to act:
                    it was therefore universally agreed, that Herennius Pontius, father of the
                    general, should be consulted by letter. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> He was
                    now grown feeble through age, and had withdrawn himself, not only from all
                    military, but also from all civil occupations; yet, notwithstanding the decline
                    of his bodily strength, his mind retained its full vigour. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> When he heard that the Roman armies were shut up at the
                    Caudine <pb n="563" xml:id="p.563"/> forks between the two glens, being
                    consulted by his son's messenger, he gave his opinion, that they should all be
                    immediately dismissed from thence unhurt. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> On
                    this counsel being rejected, and the same messenger returning a second time, he
                    recommended that they should all, to a man, be put to death. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> When these answers, so opposite to each other, like those

                        without the order of the people, nothing can be ratified that is to bind the

                        they had compelled us to repeat the established form of words for the
                        surrendering of cities, would ye, tribunes, say, that the Roman people was
                        surrendered? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> and, that this city, these
                        temples, and consecrated grounds, these lands and waters, were become the

                        having become sureties is the point insisted on. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Now, suppose we had become sureties that the Roman
                        people should quit this city; that they should set it on fire; that they

                        be ruled by kings: the gods forbid, you say. But, the enormity of the
                        articles lessens not the obligation of a compact. If there is any thing in

                        themselves proved, who were not satisfied with the security of the consuls,
                        but compelled the lieutenants-general, quaestors, and military tribunes to

                        could not command the ratification; or in behalf of you, who had given me no

                    employed in the outposts, watches, and works; and sometimes falling in with the

                    and his victorious army, both provisions had been brought in to the Samnites,

                    the field, might, perhaps, have yielded to Alexander in discharging military
                    duties in battle (for these also render him no less illustrious); and so might
                    Valerius Corvus; men who were distinguished soldiers, before they became
                    commanders. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The same, too, might have been
                    the case with the Decii, who, after devoting their persons, rushed upon the
                    enemy; or of Papirius Cursor, though possessed of such powers, both of body and
                    mind. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> By the counsels of one youth, it is
                    possible the wisdom of a whole senate, not to mention individuals, might have
                    been baffled, [consisting of such members,] that he alone, who declared that
                        <quote>it consisted of kings,</quote> conceived a correct idea of a Roman
                    senate. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> But then the danger was, that with
                    more judgment than any one of those whom I have named he might choose ground for
                    an encampment, provide supplies, guard against stratagems, distinguish the
                    season for fighting, form his line of battle, or strengthen it properly with

                    dealing with Darius, who drew after him a train of women and eunuchs; saw
                    nothing about him but gold and purple; was encumbered with the trappings of his
                    state, and should be called his prey, rather than his antagonist; whom therefore
                    he vanquished without loss of blood, and had no other merit, on the occasion,
                    than that of showing a proper spirit in despising empty show. <milestone n="17"
                        unit="section"/> The aspect of Italy would have appeared to him of a quite
                    different nature from that of India, which he traversed in the guise of a
                    reveller, at the head of a crew of drunkards, if he had seen the forests of
                    Apulia, and the mountains of Lucania, with the vestiges of the disasters of his
                    house, and where his uncle Alexander, king of Epirus, had been lately cut off. </p>

                    ground, a practice insupportable to the Macedonians, had they even been

                    respecting his birth. What must have been the consequence, if his love of wine
                    had daily become more intense? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> if his fierce
                    and uncontrollable anger? And as I mention not any one circumstance of which

                    frequently repeated by the silliest of the Greeks, who are fond of exalting the
                    reputation, even of the Parthians, at the expense of the Roman name, the danger
                    was that the Roman people would not have had resolution to bear up against the
                    splendour of Alexander's name, who, however, in my opinion, was not known to
                    them even by common fame; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> and while, in
                    Athens, a state reduced to weakness by the Macedonian arms, which at the very
                    time saw the ruins of Thebes smoking in its neighbourhood, men had spirit enough
                    to declaim with freedom against him, as is manifest from the copies of their
                    speeches, which have been preserved; [we are to be told] that out of such a
                    number of Roman chiefs, no one would have freely uttered his sentiments.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> How great soever our idea of this man's
                    greatness may be, still it is the greatness of an individual, constituted by the

                    and those who give it pre-eminence on account that the Roman people have been
                    defeated, though not in any entire war, yet in several battles, whereas
                    Alexander was never once unsuccessful in a single fight, do not consider that
                    they are comparing the actions of one man, and that a young man, with the

                    over whole pages of consuls and dictators, with whose bravery, and successes
                    also, the Roman <pb n="586" xml:id="p.586"/> people never once had reason to be

                    deserving of admiration than Alexander, or any king, is, that some of these
                    acted in the office of dictator, which lasted only ten, or it might be twenty
                    days; <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> none, in a charge of longer duration
                    than the consulship of a year; their levies obstructed by plebeian tribunes;

                    before the time, on account of elections; amidst the very busiest efforts of the
                    campaign, their year of office expired; sometimes the rashness, sometimes the
                    perverseness of a colleague, proving an impediment or detriment; and finally
                    succeeding to the unfortunate administration of a predecessor, with an army of
                    raw or ill-dis- ciplined men. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> But, on the
                    other hand, kings, being not only free from every kind of impediment, but
                    masters of circumstances and seasons, control all things in subserviency to
                    their designs, themselves uncontrolled by any. <milestone n="17" unit="section"

                        <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> Nay, the hazard had been greater on his
                    side; because the Macedonians would have had but one Alexander, who was not only

                        unit="section"/> the Romans would have had many equal to Alexander, both in
                    renown, and in the greatness of their exploits; any one of whom might live or

                    together, with respect to their numbers, the quality of the men, and their
                    supplies of auxiliaries. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Now, in the general
                    surveys of that age, there were rated two hundred and fifty thousand men; so
                    that, on every revolt of the Latin confederates, ten legions were enlisted
                    almost entirely in the city levy. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> It often
                    happened during those years, that four or five armies were employed at a time,
                    in Etruria, in Umbria, the Gauls also being at war, in Samnium, in Lucania.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then as to all Latium, with the Sabines,
                    and Volscians, the Aequans, and all Campania; half of Umbria, Etruria, and the
                    Picentians, the Marsians, Pelignians, Vestinians, and Apulians; to whom we may
                    add, the whole coast of the lower sea, possessed by the Greeks, from Thurii to
                    Neapolis and Cumae; and the Samnites from thence as far as Antium and Ostia: all
                    these he would have found either powerful allies to the Romans, or <pb n="587"
                        xml:id="p.587"/> deprived of power by their arms. He would have crossed the
                    sea with his veteran Macedonians, amounting to no more than thirty thousand
                    infantry and four thousand horse, these mostly Thessalians. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> This was the whole of his strength. Had he brought with him
                    Persians and Indians, and those other nations, it would be dragging after him an
                    encumbrance rather than a support. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Add to
                    this, that the Romans, being at home, would have had recruits at hand:
                    Alexander, waging war in a foreign country, would have found his army worn out
                    with long service, as happened afterwards to Hannibal. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> As to arms, theirs were a buckler and long spears; those of
                    the Romans, a shield, which covered the body more effectually, and a javelin, a
                    much more forcible weapon than the spear, either in throwing or striking. The
                    soldiers, on both sides, were used to steady combat, and to preserve their
                    ranks. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But the Macedonian phalanx was unapt
                    for motion, and composed of similar parts throughout: the Roman line less
                    compact, consisting of several various parts, was easily divided as occasion
                    required, and as easily conjoined. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Then what
                    soldier is comparable to the Roman in the throwing up of works? who better
                    calculated to endure fatigue? Alexander, if overcome in one battle, would have
                    been overcome in war. The Roman, whom Claudium, whom Cannae, did not crush, what
                    line of battle could crush? <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In truth, even
                    should events have been favourable to him at first, he would have often wished
                    for the Persians, the Indians, and the effeminate tribes of Asia, as opponents;
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> and would have acknowledged, that his
                    wars had been waged with women, as we are told was said by Alexander, king of
                    Epirus, after receiving his mortal wound, when comparing the wars waged in Asia
                    by this very youth, with those in which himself had been engaged. <milestone
                        n="12" unit="section"/> Indeed, when I reflect that, in the first Punic war,
                    a contest was maintained by the Romans with the Carthaginians, at sea, for
                    twenty-four years, I can scarcely suppose that the life of Alexander would have
                    been long enough for the finishing of one war [with either of <milestone
                        n="13??" unit="section"/> those nations]. And perhaps, as both the Punic
                    state was united to the Roman by ancient treaties, and as similar apprehensions
                    might arm against a common foe those two nations the most potent of the time in
                    arms and in men, he might have been overwhelmed in a Punic and a Roman war at
                    once. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The Romans have had experience of the
                    boasted prowess of <pb n="588" xml:id="p.588"/> the Macedonians in arms, not
                    indeed under Alexander as their general, or when their power was at the height,
                    but in the wars against Antiochus, Philip, and Perses; and not only not with any
                    losses, but not even with any danger to themselves. <milestone n="15"
                        unit="section"/> Let not my assertion give offence, nor our civil wars be
                    brought into mention; never were we worsted by an enemy's cavalry, never by
                    their infantry, never in open fight, never on equal ground, much less when the
                    ground was favourable. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Our soldiers, heavy
                    laden with arms, may reasonably fear a body of cavalry, or arrows; defiles of

                    more than on its own strength, formed a regular attack, and pressed on the
                    Romans. The dictator, on his part, though obliged to oppose two enemies at once,
                    yet had his line secure on both sides; for he both chose a position not easily
                    surrounded, and also formed two different fronts. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> However, he directed his greater efforts against those who
                    had sallied from the town, and, without much resistance, drove them back within
                    the walls. He then turned his whole force against the Samnites: there he found
                    greater difficulty. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> But the victory, though
                    long delayed, was neither doubtful nor alloyed by losses. The Samnites, being
                    forced to fly into their camp, extinguished their fires at night, and marched
                    away in silence; and renouncing all hopes of relieving Saticula, sat themselves
                    down before Plistia, which was in alliance with the Romans, that they might, if
                    possible, retort equal vexation on their enemy. </p>

                    Philo, both a fourth time, as the former had done, remained at Rome. Fabius came

                    but having sent for a new supply of men from home, and relying on their numbers,
                    had en- camped in the same spot as before; and, by provoking the Romans to
                    battle, endeavoured to divert them from the siege. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> The dictator, so much the more intently, pushed forward his
                    operations against the fortifications of the enemy; consider- ing that only as
                    war which was directed against the city, and showing an indifference with
                    respect to the Samnites, except that he placed guards in proper places, to
                    prevent any at- tempt on his camp. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The more
                    furiously did the Samnites ride up to the rampart, and allowed him no quiet.
                    When the enemy were now come up close to the gates of the camp, Quintus Aulius
                    Cerretanus, master of the horse, without con- sulting the dictator, sallied out
                    furiously at the head of all the troops of cavalry, and drove back the enemy.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In this de- sultory kind of fight, fortune
                    worked up the strength of the combatants in such a manner, as to occasion an
                    extraordinary loss on both sides, and the remarkable deaths of the com- manders
                    themselves. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> First, the general of the
                    Samnites, in- dignant at being repulsed, and compelled to fly from a place to
                    which he had advanced so confidently, by entreating and exhorting his horsemen,
                    renewed the battle. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As he was easily
                    distinguished among the horsemen, while he urged on the fight, the Roman master
                    of the horse galloped up against him, with his spear directed, so furiously,
                    that, with one stroke, he tumbled him lifeless from his horse. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The multitude, however, were not, as is generally the case,
                    dismayed by the fall of their leader, but rather raised to fury. All who were
                    within reach darted their weapons at Aulius, who incautiously pushed for- ward
                    among the enemy's troops; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> but the chief share
                    of the honour of revenging the death of the Samnite general they assigned to his
                    brother; he, urged by rage and grief, dragged down the victorious master of the
                    horse from his seat, and slew him. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Nor were
                    the Samnites far from obtaining his body also, as he had fallen among the
                    enemies' troops: but the Romans instantly dismounted, and the Samnites were
                    obliged to do the same; and lines being thus formed suddenly, <pb n="591"
                        xml:id="p.591"/> they began a battle on foot, round the bodies of the
                    generals, in which the Romans had manifestly the advantage; and recovering the
                    body of Aulius, carried it back in triumph to the camp, with joy mixed with
                    grief. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The Samnites having lost their
                    commander, and made a trial of their strength in this contest between the
                    cavalry, left Saticula, which they in vain hoped to relieve, and returned to the
                    siege of Plistia: within a few days after which, the Romans got possession of
                    Saticula by capitulation, and the Samnites of Plistia by force. </p>

                    separated the combatants, uncertain whether they were victorious or defeated.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> I find in some historians, that the Romans
                    were worsted in this battle, and that here Quintus Aulius, the master of the

                    of the horse in the room of Quintus Aulius, came hither with a new army from

                    where he should halt, at what time, and on what side he should fall upon the
                    enemy, and, being sufficiently apprized of his designs in every particular, he

                    for several days after the engagement, like one besieged, rather than a

                        unit="section"/> and judging it the more efficacious method of inflaming the
                    courage of brave men, to let none have any room for hope but in himself, he kept
                    secret from the troops the arrival of the master of the horse and the new army;
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> and, as if there were no safety but in

                    spirits inflamed by the dictator's discourse, which seemed indicative of an
                    extreme necessity; and, at the same time, the very sight of the camp burning
                    behind them, though the nearest part only was set on fire, (for so the dictator
                    had ordered,) was no small incitement: <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    rushing on therefore like madmen, they disordered the enemy's battalions at the

                    these inquiries. Caius Maenius was accordingly nominated, and he appointed
                    Marcus Foslius master of the horse. People's dread of that office was very
                    great, insomuch that the Calavii, Ovius and Novius, who were the heads of the
                    conspiracy, either through fear of the dictator's power, or the consciousness of
                    guilt, previous to the charge against them being laid in form before him,

                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Then the Samnites, making a short circuit
                    through an open tract, marched down their troops into level ground in the

                    other. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Trial of their strength in slight
                    skirmishes was made on both sides, more frequently between the horse than the
                    foot; and the Romans were no way dissatisfied either at the issue of these, or
                    at the delay by which they protracted the war. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    The Samnite generals, on the contrary, considered that their battalions were
                    becoming weakened daily by small losses, and the general vigour abated by
                    prolonging the war. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They therefore marched
                    into the field, disposing their cavalry on both wings, with orders to give more

                    either with design of turning the flank of the enemy, or to avoid being

                    that they were formed in more compact order, an addition was made to their
                    strength, by a sudden act of the consul Pœtelius; for the subsidiary cohorts,
                    which were usually reserved for the exigencies of a tedious fight, he brought up
                    immediately to the front, and, in the first onset, pushed the enemy with the

                    infantry giving way, their cavalry advanced to support them; and as they were
                    charging in an oblique direction between the two lines, the Roman horse, coming
                    up at full speed, disordered their battalions and ranks of infantry and cavalry,
                    so as to oblige the whole line on that side to give ground. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> The left wing had not only the presence of Pœtelius to
                    animate them, but that of Sulpicius likewise; who, on the shout being first

                        unit="section"/> However, the arrival of the consul effected a speedy change
                    in every particular; for, on the sight of their leader, the spirit of the
                    soldiers was revived, and the bravery of the men who came with him rendered them
                    more powerful aid than even their number; while the news of success in the other

                    commencement of their office, they complained before the people, that, by the
                    improper choice of members of the senate, that body had been disgraced, several

                    such election, which had been made without distinction of right or wrong, merely
                    to gratify interest or humour: they then im- mediately called over the list of
                    the senate, in the same order which had existed before the censorship of Appius
                    Claudius and Caius Plautius. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Two public
                    employments, both relating to military affairs, came this year into the disposal
                    of the peo- ple; one being an order, that sixteen of the tribunes, for four
                    legions, should be appointed by the people; whereas hitherto they had been
                    generally in the gift of the dictators and con- <pb n="601" xml:id="p.601"/>
                    suls, very few of the places being left to suffrage. This order was proposed by
                    Lucius Atilius and Caius Marcius, plebeian tribunes. Another was, that the
                    people likewise should constitute two naval commissioners, for the equipping and
                    refitting of the fleet. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The person who

                    Another transaction of this year I should pass over as trifling, did it not seem

                    customary from very early times, went off in a body to Tibur; so that there was
                    not one left in the city to play at the sacrifices. The religious tendency of
                    this affair gave uneasiness to the senate; and they sent envoys to Tibur to
                    endeavour that these men might be sent back to Rome. <milestone n="6"

                    day, they invited them separately to their several houses, apparently with the
                    intention of heightening the pleasure of their feasts with music, and there
                    plied them with wine, of which such people are always fond, until they laid them
                    asleep. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> In this state of insensibility they
                    threw them into waggons, and carried them away to Rome: nor did they know any
                    thing of the matter, until, the waggons having been left in the forum, the light

                    city in full dress, with music, and the licence which is now practised every

                    the right of being fed in the temple, was restored to those who played at the

                        all knew it; and they therefore obeyed the Aemilian law, rather than the old
                        one, under which the censors had been at first created; because it was the
                        last order; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> and because, when two laws are
                        contradictory, the new always repeals the old. Do you mean to say, Appius,

                        out of resentment for the limitation of their power, they disfranchised
                        Mamercus Aemilius, the first man of the age, either in war or peace.

                    having left a space sufficient for the Romans to draw up, opposite to them;
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> but perceiving that the enemy declined
                    fighting, they advanced to the rampart; where, when they observed that even the
                    advanced guards had retired within the works, a shout at once was raised around
                    their generals, that they should order provisions for that day to be brought
                    down to them: <quote> for they were resolved to remain there under arms; and
                        either in the night, or, at all events, at the dawn of day, to attack the
                        enemy's camp. </quote>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Roman troops, though not less eager for
                    action, were restrained by the commands of the general. About the tenth hour,
                    the consul ordered his men a repast; and gave directions that they should be
                    ready in arms, at whatever time of the day or night he should give the signal.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He then addressed a few words to them;
                    spoke in high terms of the wars of the Samnites, and disparagingly of the
                    Etrurians, who <quote>were not,</quote> he said, <quote> as an enemy to be
                        compared with other enemies, nor as a numerous force, with others in point
                        of numbers. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Besides, he had an engine at
                        work, as they should find in due time; at present it was of importance to
                        keep it secret. </quote> By these hints he intimated that the enemy was
                    circumvented in order to raise the courage of his men, damped by the superiority
                    of the enemy's force; and, from their not having fortified the post where they
                    lay, the insinuation of a stratagem formed against them seemed the more
                    credible. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> After refreshing themselves, they
                    consigned themselves to rest, and being roused without noise, about the fourth
                    watch, took arms. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Axes are distributed among
                    the servants following the army, to tear down the rampart and fill up the
                    trench. The line was formed within the works, and some chosen cohorts posted
                    close to the gates. Then, a little before day, which in sum- mer nights is the
                    time of the profoundest sleep, the signal being given, the rampart was levelled,
                    and the troops rushing forth, fell upon the enemy, who were every where
                    stretched <pb n="612" xml:id="p.612"/> at their length. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Some were put to death before they could stir; others half
                    asleep, in their beds; the greatest part, while they ran in confusion to arms;
                    few, in short, had time afforded them to arm themselves; and these, who followed
                    no particular leader, nor orders, were quickly routed by the Romans and pursued
                    by the Roman horse. They fled different ways; to the camp and to the woods. The
                    latter afforded the safer refuge; for the former, being situated in a plain, was
                    taken the same day. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The gold and silver was
                    ordered to be brought to the consul; the rest of the spoil was given to the
                    soldiers. On that day, sixty thousand of the enemy were slain or taken. Some
                    affirm, that this famous battle was fought on the farther side of the Ciminian
                    forest, at Perusia; and that the public had been under great dread, lest the
                    army might be enclosed in such a dangerous pass, and overpowered by a general
                    combination of the Etrurians and Umbrians. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    But on whatever spot it was fought, it is certain that the Roman power
                    prevailed; and, in consequence thereof, ambassadors from Perusia, Cortona, and
                    Arretium, which were then among the principal states of Etruria, soliciting a
                    peace and alliance with the Romans, obtained a truce for thirty years. </p>

                    and many of their forts, and smaller towns, were either destroyed by his arms,
                    or surrendered without being injured. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> About
                    the same time also, the Roman fleet, having sailed to Campania, under Publius
                    Cornelius, to whom the senate had given the command on the sea-coast, put into
                    Pompeii. Immediately on landing, the soldiers of the fleet set out to ravage the
                    country about Nuceria: and after they had quickly laid waste the parts which lay
                    nearest, and whence they could have returned to the ships with safety, they were
                    allured by the temptation of plunder, as it often happens, to advance too far,
                    and thereby roused the enemy against them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    While they rambled about the country, they met no opposition, though they might
                    have been cut off to a man; but as they were returning, in a careless manner,
                    the peasants overtook them, not far from the ships, stripped them of the booty,
                    and even slew a great part of them. Those who escaped were driven in confusion
                    to the ships. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As Fabius' having marched
                    through the Ciminian forest had occasioned violent apprehensions at Rome, <pb

                    in Samnium: they talked of the Roman army being pent up, and surrounded; and of
                    the Caudine forks, as a model of their defeat. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    <quote>Those people,</quote> they said, <quote> ever greedy after further

                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Their joy was even mingled with a degree of
                    envy, because fortune, as they thought, had transferred the glory of finishing
                    the Roman war, from the Samnites to the Etrurians: <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> they hastened, therefore, with their whole collected force,
                    to crush the consul Caius Marcius; resolving, if he did not give them an
                    opportunity of fighting, to proceed, through the territories of the Marsians and
                    Sabines, into Etruria. The consul met them, and a battle was fought with great
                    fury on both sides, but without a decisive issue. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Although both parties suffered severely, yet the discredit
                    of defeat fell on the Romans, because several of equestrian rank, some military
                    tribunes, with one lieutenant-general, had fallen; and, what was more remarkable
                    than all, the consul himself was wounded. On account of this event, exaggerated
                    by report as is usual, the senate became greatly alarmed, so that they resolved
                    on having a dictator nominated. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> No one
                    entertained a doubt that the nomination would light on Papirius Cursor, who was
                    then universally deemed to possess the greatest abilities as a commander: but
                    they could not be certain, either that a message might be conveyed with safety
                    into Samnium, where all was in a state of hostility, or that the consul Marcius
                    was alive. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The other consul, Fabius, was at
                    enmity with Papirius, on his own account; and lest this resentment might prove
                    an obstacle to the public good, the senate voted that deputies of consular rank
                    should be sent to <milestone n="11??" unit="section"/> him, who, uniting their
                    own influence to that of government, might prevail on him to drop, for the sake

                    the decree of the senate, adding such arguments as were suitable to their
                    instructions, the consul, casting his eyes towards the ground, retired in
                    silence, leaving them in uncertainty what part he intended to act. <milestone
                        n="13" unit="section"/> Then, in the silent time of the night, according to
                    the established custom, he nominated Lucius Papirius dictator. When the deputies
                    returned him <pb n="614" xml:id="p.614"/> thanks, for so very meritoriously
                    subduing his passion, he still persevered in obstinate silence, and dismissed
                    them without any answer, or mention of what he had done: a proof that he felt an
                    extraordinary degree of resentment, which had been suppressed within his breast.
                        <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Papirius appointed Caius Junius Bubulcus

                    of the consul Marcius, he led on his forces to battle; nor did the enemy seem to

                        unit="section"/> After this, they continued a considerable time encamped
                    near each other, without coming to action; neither diffident of their own

                    Meanwhile matters went on actively in Etruria; for a decisive battle was fought
                    with the Umbrians, in which the enemy was routed, but lost not many men, for
                    they did not maintain the fight with the vigour with which they began it.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Besides this the Etrurians, having raised
                    an army under the sanctions of the devoting law, each man choosing another, came
                    to an engagement at the Cape of Vadimon, with more numerous forces, and, at the
                    same time, with greater spirit than they had ever shown before. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> The battle was fought with such animosity that no javelins
                    were thrown by either party: swords alone were made use <pb n="615"

                    inflamed by the long-continued contest; so that it appeared to the Romans as if
                    they were disputing, not with Etrurians, whom they had so often conquered, but
                    with a new race. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Not the semblance of giving

                        unit="section"/> When the addition of this new alarm assailed the enemies'
                    troops on both sides, and the Roman legions, having renewed the shout to
                    confound the enemy, rushed on, they began to fly. <milestone n="14"
                        unit="section"/> And now the plains were quickly filled with heaps of bodies
                    and splendid armour. At first, their camp received the dismayed Samnites; but
                    they did not long retain even the possession of that: before night it was taken,
                    plundered, and burnt. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> The dictator triumphed,
                    in pursuance of a decree of the senate; <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> and
                    the most splendid spectacle by far, of any in his procession, was the captured
                    arms: so magnificent were they deemed, that the shields, adorned with gold, were
                    distributed among the owners of the silver shops, to serve as embellishments to
                    the forum. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Hence, it is said, arose the
                    custom of the forum <pb n="617" xml:id="p.617"/> being decorated by the aediles,
                    when the grand processions are made, on occasion of the great games. The Romans,
                    indeed, converted these extraordinary arms to the honour of the gods: <milestone
                        n="18" unit="section"/> but the Campanians, out of pride, and in hatred of
                    the Samnites, gave them as ornaments to their gladiators, who used to be
                    exhibited as a show at their feasts, and whom they distinguished by the name of
                    Samnites. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> During this year, the consul Fabius
                    fought with the remnants of the Etrurians at Perusia, which city also had
                    violated the truce, and gained an easy and decisive victory. <milestone n="20"
                        unit="section"/> He would have taken the town itself; (for he marched up to
                    the walls,) had not deputies come out and capitulated. Having placed a garrison
                    at Perusia, and sent on before him to the Roman senate the embassies of Etruria,
                    who solicited friendship, the consul rode into the city in triumph, for
                    successes more important than those of the dictator. <milestone n="21"
                        unit="section"/> Besides, a great share of the honour of reducing the
                    Samnites was attributed to the lieutenants-general, Publius Decius and Marcius
                    Valerius: whom, at the next election, the people, with universal consent,
                    declared the one consul, the other praetor. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> To Fabius, in consideration of his
                    extraordinary merit in the conquest of Etruria, the consulship was continued.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Decius was appointed his colleague.
                    Valerius was created Praetor a fourth time. The consuls divided the provinces
                    between them. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Etruria fell to Decius, Samnium
                    to Fabius. The latter, having marched to Nuceria, rejected the application of
                    the people of Alfaterna, who then sued for peace, because they had not accepted
                    it when offered, and by force of arms compelled them to surrender. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> A battle was fought with the Samnites; the enemy were
                    overcome without much difficulty: nor would the memory of that engagement have
                    been preserved, except that in it the Marsians first appeared in arms against
                    the Romans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Pelignians, imitating the
                    defection of the Marsians, met the same fate. The other consul, Decius, was
                    likewise very successful in his operations: through terror he compelled the
                    Tarquinians to supply his army with corn, and to sue for a truce for forty
                    years. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He took several forts from the
                    Volsinians by assault, some of which he demolished, that they might not serve as
                    receptacles to the enemy, and by extending his operations through every quarter,
                    diffused such a dread of his arms, that the whole <pb n="618" xml:id="p.618"/>
                    Etrurian nation sued to the consul for an alliance: this they did not obtain;
                    but a truce for a year was granted them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                    pay of the Roman army for that year was furnished by the enemy; and two tunics
                    for each soldier were exacted from them: this was the purchase of the truce.'
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The tranquillity now established in
                    Etruria was interrupted by a sudden insurrection of the Umbrians, a nation which
                    had suffered no injury from the war, except what inconvenience the country had
                    felt in the passing of the army. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> These, by
                    calling into the field all their own young men, and forcing a great part of the
                    Etrurians to resume their arms, made up such a numerous force, that speaking of
                    themselves with ostentatious vanity, and of the Romans with contempt, they
                    boasted that they would leave Decius behind in Etruria, and march away to
                    besiege Rome; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> which design of theirs being
                    reported to the consul Decius, he removed by long marches from Etruria towards
                    their city, and sat down in the district of Pupinia, in readiness to act
                    according to the intelligence received of the enemy. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> Nor was the insurrection of the Umbrians slighted at Rome:
                    their very threats excited tears among the people, who had experienced, in the
                    calamities suffered from the Gauls, how insecure a city they inhabited.
                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Deputies were therefore despatched to the
                    consul Fabius with directions, that, if he had any respite from the war of the
                    Samnites, he should with all haste lead his army into Umbria. <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> The consul obeyed the order, and by forced marches
                    proceeded to Mevania, where the forces of the Umbrians then lay. <milestone
                        n="14" unit="section"/> The unexpected arrival of the consul, whom they had
                    believed to be sufficiently employed in Samnium, far distant from their country,
                    so thoroughly affrighted the Umbrians, that several advised retiring to their
                    fortified towns; others, the discontinuing the war. However, one district,
                    called by themselves Materina, prevailed on the rest not only to retain their
                    arms, but to come to an immediate engagement. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                    They fell upon Fabius while he was fortifying his camp. <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/> When the consul saw them rushing impetuously towards his
                    rampart, he called off his men from the work, and drew them up in the best
                    manner which the nature of the place and the time allowed; encouraging them by
                    displaying, in honourable and just terms, the glory which they had acquired, as
                    well in Etruria as in Samnium, he bade them finish this insignificant appendage
                        <pb n="619" xml:id="p.619"/> to the Etrurian war, and take vengeance for the
                    impious expressions in which these people had threatened to attack the city of
                    Rome. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Such was the alacrity of the soldiers
                    on hearing this, that, raising the shout spontaneously, they interrupted the
                    general's discourse, and, without waiting for orders, advanced, with the sound
                    of all the trumpets and cornets, in full speed against the enemy. <milestone
                        n="18" unit="section"/> They made their attack not as on men, or at least
                    men in arms, but, what must appear wonderful in the relation, began by snatching
                    the standards out of the hands which held them; and then, the standard-bearers
                    themselves were dragged to the consul, and the armed soldiers transferred from
                    the one line to the other; and wherever resistance was any where made, the
                    business was performed, not so much with swords, as with their shields, with the
                    bosses of which, and thrusts of their elbows, they bore down the foe. <milestone
                        n="19" unit="section"/> The prisoners were more numerous than the slain, and
                    through the whole line the Umbrians called on each other, with one voice, to lay
                    down their arms. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> Thus a surrender was made in
                    the midst of action, by the first promoters of the war; and on the next and
                    following days, the other states of the Umbrians also surrendered. The
                    Ocriculans were admitted to a treaty of friendship on giving security. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Fabius, successful in a war allotted to
                    another, led back his army into his own province. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> And as, in the preceding year, the people had, in
                    consideration of his services so successfully performed, re-elected him to the
                    consulship, so now the senate, from the same motive, notwithstanding a warm
                    opposition made by Appius, prolonged his command for the year following, in
                    which Appius Claudius and Lucius Volumnius were consuls. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> In some annals I find, that Appius, still holding the
                    office of censor, declared himself a candidate for the consulship, and that his
                    election was stopped by a protest of Lucius Furius, plebeian tribune, until he
                    resigned the censorship. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> After his election to
                    the consulship, the new war with the Sallentine enemies being decreed to his
                    colleague, he remained at Rome, with design to increase his interest by city
                    intrigues, since the means of procuring honour in war were placed in the hands
                    of others. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Volumnius had no reason to be
                    dissatisfied with his province: he fought many battles with good success, and
                    took several cities by assault. He was <pb n="620" xml:id="p.620"/> liberal in
                    his donations of the spoil; and this munificence, engaging in itself, he
                    enhanced by his courteous demeanour, by which conduct he inspired his soldiers
                    with ardour to meet both toil and danger. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Quintus Fabius, proconsul, fought a pitched battle with the armies of the
                    Samnites, near the city of Allifae. The victory was complete. The enemy were
                    driven from the field, and pursued to their camp; nor would they have kept
                    possession of that, had not the day been almost spent. It was invested, however,
                    before night, and guarded until day, lest any should slip away. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> Next morning, while it was scarcely clear day, they
                    proposed to capitulate, and it was agreed, that such as were natives of Samnium
                    should be dismissed with single garments. All these were sent under the yoke.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> No precaution was taken in favour of the
                    allies of the Samnites: they were sold by auction, to the number of seven
                    thousand. Those who declared themselves subjects of the Hernicians, were kept by
                    themselves under a guard. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> All these Fabius
                    sent to Rome to the senate; and, after being examined, whether it was in
                    consequence of a public order, or as volunteers, that they had carried arms on
                    the side of the Samnites against the Romans, they were distributed among the
                    states of the Latins to be held in custody; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    and it was ordered, that the new consuls, Publius Cornelius Arvina and Quintus
                    Marcius Tremulus, who by this time had been elected, should lay that affair
                    entire before the senate: <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> this gave such
                    offence to the Hernicians, that, at a meeting of all the states, assembled by
                    the Anagnians, in the circus called the Maritime, the whole nation of the
                    Hernicians, excepting the Alatrians, Ferentines, and Verulans, declared war
                    against the Roman people. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> In Samnium also, in consequence of the
                    departure of Fabius, new commotions arose. Calatia and Sora, and the Roman
                    garrisons stationed there, were taken, and extreme cruelty was exercised towards
                    the captive soldiers: Publius Cornelius was therefore sent thither with an army.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The command against the new enemy (for by
                    this time an order had passed for declaring war against the Anagnians, and the

                    /> These, in the beginning, secured all the passes between the camps of the
                    consuls, in such a manner, that no messenger, however expert, could make his way
                    from one to the other; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> and each <pb n="621"
                        xml:id="p.621"/> consul spent several days in absolute uncertainty regarding
                    every matter and in anxious suspense concerning the state of the other.
                    Apprehensions for their safety spread even to Rome; so that all the younger
                    citizens were compelled to enlist, and two regular armies were raised, to answer
                    sudden emergencies. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The conduct of the
                    Hernicians during the progress of the war afterwards, showed nothing suitable to
                    the present alarm, or to the ancient renown of that nation. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Without ever venturing any effort worth mentioning, being
                    stripped of three different camps within a few days, they stipulated for a truce
                    of thirty days, during which they might send to Rome, to the senate, on the
                    terms of furnishing two months' pay, and corn, and a tunic to every soldier.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They were referred back to Marcius by the
                    senate, whom by a decree they empowered to determine regarding the Hernicians,
                    and he accepted their submission. Meanwhile, in Samnium, the other consul,
                    though superior in strength, was very much embarrassed by the nature of his
                    situation; the enemy had blocked up all the roads, and seized on the passable
                    defiles, so that no provisions could be conveyed; <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> nor could the consul, though he daily drew out his troops
                    and offered battle, allure them to an engagement. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> It was evident, that neither could the Samnites support an
                    immediate contest, nor the Romans a delay of action. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The approach of Marcius, who, after he had subdued the
                    Hernicians, hastened to the succour of his colleague, put it out of the enemy's
                    power any longer to avoid fighting: <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> for they,
                    who had not deemed themselves a match in the field, even for one of the armies,
                    could not surely suppose that if they should allow the two consular armies to
                    unite, they could have any hope remaining: they made an attack therefore on
                    Marcius, as he was approaching in the irregular order of march. <milestone

                    centre, and the line formed as well as the time permitted. First the shout which
                    reached the standing camp of Cornelius, then the dust observed at a distance,
                    excited a bustle in the camp of the other consul. <milestone n="13"

                    which when the soldiers of Marcius saw in flames, and the enemy observed it on

                    one body, their several forces, who were employed in mutual congratulations,
                    when some new cohorts of the enemy, which had been levied for a reinforcement,
                    being seen at a distance, occasioned a renewal of the carnage. <milestone n="18"
                        unit="section"/> On these the conquerors rushed, without any order of the
                    consuls, or signal received, crying out, that they would make these Samnites pay
                    dearly for their introduction to service. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> The
                    consuls indulged the ardour of the legions, well knowing that the raw troops of
                    the enemy, mixed with veterans dispirited by defeat, would be incapable even of
                    attempting a contest. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> Nor were they wrong in
                    their judgment: all the forces of the Samnites, old and new, fled to the nearest
                    mountains. These the Roman army also ascended, so that no situation afforded
                    safety to the vanquished; they were beaten off, even from the summits which they
                    had seized. And now they all, with one voice, supplicated for a suspension of
                    arms. <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> On which, being ordered to furnish corn
                    for three months, pay for a year, and a tunic to each of the soldiers, they sent
                    deputies to the senate to sue for peace. Cornelius was left in Samnium.

                    triumph over the Hernicians; and a decree was passed for erecting to him, in the

                        <milestone n="23" unit="section"/> To three states of the Hernicians, (the
                    Alatrians, Verulans, and Ferentines,) their own laws were restored, because they
                    preferred these to the being made citizens of Rome; and they were permitted to
                    intermarry with each other, a privilege which they alone of the Hernicians, for
                    a long time after, enjoyed. <milestone n="24" unit="section"/> To the Anagnians,
                    and the others, who had made war on the Romans, was granted the freedom of the

                    not allowed them, and their magistrates were prohibited from acting except in
                    the ministration of public worship. <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>

                    consulate in the war with the Samnites. By the same person, and his colleague,
                    Marcus Valerius Maximus, roads were made through the fields at the public

                    were Lucius Postumius and Titus Minucius; whom Piso places next after Quintus

                    regions, Postumius to Tifernum, Minucius to Bovianum. The first engagement
                    happened at Tifernum, under the command of Postumius. <milestone n="7"

                    Others, that the army separated without victory on either side; and that
                    Postumius, counterfeiting fear, withdrew his forces privately by night, and
                    marched away to the mountains; whither the enemy also followed, and took
                    possession of a strong-hold two miles distant. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    The consul, having created a belief that he had come thither for the sake of a
                    safe post, and a fruitful spot, (and such it really was,) secured his camp with
                    strong works. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Furnishing it with magazines of
                    every thing useful, he left a strong guard to defend it; and at the third watch,
                    led away the legions lightly accoutred, by the shortest road which he could
                    take, to join his colleague, who lay opposite to his foe. <milestone n="11"

                    engagement with the enemy; and when the fight had continued doubtful through a

                    legions, made an unexpected attack on the enemy's line, spent by this time with

                    rendered them incapable even of flying, they were cut off to a man, and
                    twenty-one standards taken. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The Romans then
                    proceeded to Postumius's station, where the two victorious armies falling upon
                    the enemy, already dismayed by the news of what had passed, routed and dispersed
                    them: twenty-six military standards were taken here, and the Samnite general,
                    Statius Gellius, with a great number of other prisoners, and both the camps were
                    taken. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Next day Bovianum was besieged, and
                    soon after taken. Both the consuls were honoured with a triumph, with high
                    applause of their excellent conduct. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Some
                    writers say, that the consul Minucius was brought back to the camp grievously
                    wounded, and that he died there; that Marcus Fulvius was substituted consul in
                    his place, and that it was he who, being sent to command Minucius's army, took
                    Bovianum. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> During the same year, Sora,
                    Arpinum, and Censennia were recovered from the Samnites. The great statue of

                        have produced the desired effect. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> But now,
                        since words had hitherto proved vain, people's conduct must be guided by
                        facts: that Publius Sempronius the consul would shortly be in Samnium with
                        an army: that he could not be deceived in judging whether their dispositions
                        inclined to peace or war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He would bring

                    without dissembling that they acted by public authority, had revolted to the

                    ambassadors were sent to demand satisfaction, they said, that <quote> this was
                        only a trial made of them, on the expectation that they would through fear

                    their own account, were all in disorder and confusion, without established
                    officers and without command. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Some advised to
                    give battle, others to defend the camp; the greater part were influenced by
                    concern for the devastation of their lands, likely to take place, and the
                    consequent destruction of their cities, left with weak garrisons. <milestone

                    apprehension of some stratagem. At length, passing over the rampart, and finding

                    The Marrucinians, Marsians, Pelignians, and Ferentans, warned by the example of
