                <head>Summary of Book XIII</head>
                <p> THE consul Valerius Laevinus fought a losing engagement with Pyrrhus, the
                    soldiers being greatly terrified by the strange sight of the elephants.
                        <reg>after</reg> this battle, when Pyrrhus was looking at the bodies of the
                    Romans who had fallen, he found that they all faced their enemies, and laying
                    waste the country, advanced towards the city of Rome. <name>Gaius</name>
                    Fabricius, being sent to him by the senate to treat for the ransom of the
                    prisoners, was in vain solicited by the King to forsake his country.
                        <name>The</name> prisoners were released without a price. <reg>cineas</reg>
                    , having been dispatched by Pyrrhus as an envoy to the senate, asked that the
                    King might be received into the City for the purpose of arranging terms of
                    peace. <reg>on</reg> its having been resolved to refer this proposal to a fuller
                    meeting of the senate, Appius Claudius, who by reason of a weakness of the eyes
                    had long abstained from public <pb n="p.551"/> business, entered the Curia and
                    by his speech prevailed on the senators to deny Pyrrhus his request.
                        <name>Gnaeus</name> Domitius was the first plebeian censor to close the
                    lustrum. <name>The</name> number of the citizens was returned as 287,222. There
                    was a second battle with Pyrrhus, of an indecisive nature. <name>The</name>
                    treaty with the Carthaginians was renewed for the fourth time. <reg>when</reg> a
                    deserter from Pyrrhus promised Gaius Fabricius the consul that he would poison
                    the King, Fabricius sent him back to the King with the story of his guilt.
                        <name>The</name> book contains also successful campaigns against the
                    Lucanians and the Bruttians, the Samnites and the Etruscans. </p>
