                    <p>
                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> While these operations in Spain and Africa
                        were going on, Hannibal spent the whole summer in the Sallentine territory
                        in the hope of securing the city of Tarentum by treachery, and whilst he was
                        there some unimportant towns seceded to him. <milestone n="2" unit="section"
                        /> Out of the twelve communities in Bruttium who had gone over to the
                        Carthaginians the year before, two, namely Consentia and Thurii, returned to
                        their old allegiance to Rome, and more would have done so had it not been
                        for T. Pomponius Veientanus, an officer of allies. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> He had made several successful raids in Bruttium and
                        had in consequence began to be regarded as a regularly commissioned general.
                        With the raw and undisciplined army which he had got together he engaged
                        Hanno. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In that battle a great number of
                        men, who were simply a confused crowd of peasants and slaves, were killed or
                        made prisoners; the least important loss was that of the officer himself,
                        who was made prisoner. For not only was he responsible for such a reckless
                        and ill-advised battle, but in his capacity as a public contractor he had
                        previously been guilty of all sorts of dishonest practices and robbed both
                        the State and the City guilds. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The consul
                        Sempronius fought several trifling actions in Lucania, none of which are
                        worth recording, and took some unimportant towns belonging to the Lucanians. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The longer the war continued, and the more
                        men's minds as well as their fortunes were affected by the alternations of
                        success and failure, so much the more did the citizens become the victims of
                        superstitions, and those for the most part foreign ones. It seemed as though
                        either the characters of men or the nature of the gods had undergone a
                        sudden change. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Roman ritual was
                        growing into disuse not only in secret and in private houses; even in public
                        places, in the Forum and the Capitol, crowds of women were to be seen who
                        were offering neither sacrifices nor prayers in accordance with ancient
                        usage. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Unauthorised sacrificers and
                        diviners had got possession of men's minds and the numbers of their dupes
                        were swelled by the crowds of country people whom poverty or fear had driven
                        into the City, and whose fields had lain untilled owing to the length of the
                        war or had been desolated by the enemy. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        These impostors found their profit in trading upon the ignorance of others,
                        and they practiced their calling with as much effrontery as if they had been
                        duly authorised by the State. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Respectable
                        citizens protested in private against the state of things, and ultimately
                        the matter became a public scandal and formal complaint was made to the
                        senate. The aediles and commissioners of police were severely reprimanded by
                        the senate for not preventing these abuses, but when they attempted to
                        remove the crowds from the Forum and destroy the altars and other
                        preparations for their rites they narrowly escaped being roughly handled.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As the mischief appeared to be too
                        much for the inferior magistrates to deal with, M. Aemilius, the City
                        praetor, was entrusted with the task of delivering the people from these
                        superstitions. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He read the resolution of
                        the senate before the Assembly and gave notice that all those who had in
                        their possession any manuals of divination or forms of prayers or
                        sacrificial ritual in writing were to bring all their books and writings to
                        him before the first of April, and no one was to use any strange or foreign
                        form of sacrifice in any public or consecrated place. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Several officials connected with the State
                        religion died this year: L. Cornelius Lentulus the chief pontiff, C.
                        Papirius, son of C. Masso, one of the pontiffs, P. Furius Philus the augur,
                        and C. Papirius, son of L. Maso, one of the Keepers of the Sacred Books.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> M. Cornelius Cethegus was appointed
                        chief pontiff in place of Lentulus, and Cn. Servilius Caepio in place of
                        Papirius. L. Quintius Flamininus was appointed augur and L. Cornelius
                        Lentulus Keeper of the Sacred Books. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The
                        time for the consular elections was now drawing near, and as it was decided
                        not to recall the consuls who were engaged in the war, Tiberius Sempronius
                        nominated C. Claudius Cento Dictator for the purpose of conducting the
                        elections. He appointed Q. Fulvius Flaccus as his Master of the Horse.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The elections were completed on the
                        first day; the Dictator returned as duly elected consuls Q. Fulvius Flaccus,
                        Master of the Horse, and Appius Claudius Pulcher, who was at the time
                        praetor in Sicily. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then the praetors were
                        elected; Cn. Fulvius Flaccus, C. Claudius Nero, M. Junius Silanus, and P.
                        Cornelius Sulla. When the elections were over the Dictator resigned.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The curule aediles for the year were
                        M. Cornelius Cethegus and P. Cornelius Scipio, who was subsequently known as
                        Africanus. When the latter offered himself as a candidate, the tribunes of
                        the plebs objected to him, and said that he could not be allowed to stand
                        because he had not yet reached the legal age. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> His reply was: "If the Quirites are unanimous in their
                        desire to appoint me aedile, I am quite old enough." On this the people
                        hurried to give their tribal votes for him with such eagerness that the
                        tribunes abandoned their opposition. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        new aediles discharged their functions with great munificence; the Roman
                        Games were celebrated on a grand scale considering their resources at the
                        time; they were repeated a second day and a congius of oil was distributed
                        in each street. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> L. Villius Tappulus and M.
                        Fundanius Fundulus, the plebeian aediles, summoned several matrons before
                        the people on a charge of misconduct; some of them were convicted and sent
                        into exile. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The celebration of the
                        Plebeian Games lasted two days and there was a solemn banquet in the Capitol
                        on the occasion of the Games. </p>

                        entered on their consulship, the former for the third time. The praetors
                        drew lots for their provinces; P. Cornelius Sulla had assigned to him both
                        the home and foreign jurisdiction, which had previously been held
                        separately; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Apulia fell to Cn. Fulvius
                        Flaccus; Suessula to C. Claudius Nero; Etruria to M. Junius Silanus.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Two legions were decreed for each of
                        the consuls in the operations against Hannibal; one consul took over the
                        army from Q. Fabius, the consul of the previous year, the other that of
                        Fulvius Centumalus. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> With regard to the
                        praetors, Fulvius Flaccus was to have the legions which were at Luceria
                        under Aemilius, Claudius Nero those which were serving in Picenum under C.
                        Terentius, and they were each to raise their force to its full complement.
                        The City legions raised the previous year were assigned to M. Junius to meet
                        any movement from Etruria. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Ti. Sempronius
                        Gracchus and P. Sempronius Tuditanus had their commands extended in their
                        respective provinces of Lucania and Cis-Alpine Gaul, as also had P. Lentulus
                        in the Roman province of Sicily and M. Marcellus in Syracuse and that part
                        of the island over which Hiero had reigned. <milestone n="6" unit="section"
                        /> The command of the fleet was left in the hands of T. Otacilius, the
                        operations in Greece in those of M. Valerius, the campaign in Sardinia was
                        still to be under the conduct of Q. Mucius Scaevola, whilst the two Scipios
                        were to continue their work in Spain. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In
                        addition to the existing armies two fresh legions were raised in the City by
                        the consuls, thus bringing up the total number to twenty-three legions for
                        the year. </p>

                        conduct of M. Postumius Pyrgensis which might have endangered the stability
                        of the republic. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> This man was a public
                        contractor and for many years had had only one man to match him in
                        dishonesty and greed, and that was T. Pomponius Veientanus, whom the
                        Carthaginians under Hanno got hold of while he was recklessly raiding
                        Lucania. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The State had made itself
                        responsible where supplies intended for the armies were lost through storms
                        at sea, and these men invented stories of shipwrecks, and when they did not
                        invent, the shipwrecks which they reported were due to their dishonesty, not
                        to accident. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> They placed small and
                        worthless cargoes on old shattered ships, which they sank when out at sea,
                        the sailors being taken into boats which were kept in readiness, and then
                        they made a false declaration as to the cargo, putting it at many times its
                        real value. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> This fraud had been disclosed
                        to M. Aemilius, the praetor, and he laid the matter before the senate, but
                        they had taken no action because they were anxious not to offend the body of
                        public contractors at such a time as that. <milestone n="13" unit="section"
                        /> The people, however, took a much severer view of the case, and at length
                        two tribunes of the plebs, Spurius Carvilius and L. Carvilius, seeing the
                        public indignation and disgust aroused, demanded that a fine of 200,000 ases
                        should be imposed on them. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> When the day
                        came for the question to be decided, the plebs were present in such great
                        numbers that the space on the Capitol hardly held them, and after the case
                        had been gone through, the only hope left to the defence was the chance of
                        C. Servilius Casca, <milestone n="15??" unit="section"/> a tribune of the
                        plebs and a near relative of Postumius, interposing his veto before the
                        tribes proceeded to vote. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> When the
                        evidence had been given, the tribunes ordered the people to withdraw and the
                        voting urn was brought in, in order that it might be determined in what
                        tribe the Latins were to vote. While this was being done the contractors
                        urged Casca to stop the proceedings for the day, and the people loudly
                        opposed that step. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Casca happened to be
                        sitting in front at the end of the tribunal seats, and he was labouring
                        under the conflicting emotions of fear and shame. <milestone n="18"
                            unit="section"/> Seeing that no dependence was to be placed upon him,
                        the contractors determined to create a disturbance and rushed in a compact
                        body into the space left vacant by the withdrawal of the Assembly, loudly
                        abusing both the people and the tribunes. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                        As there was every prospect of a hand-to-hand fight the consul Fulvius said
                        to the tribunes: "Do you not see that your authority has gone, and that
                        there will certainly be a riot if you do not dismiss the meeting?" </p>

                        This indictment was listened to by all good citizens with feelings of
                        indignation proportioned to the atrocity of the outrage, and the senate
                        passed a decree affirming that "that violent conduct was an offence against
                        the republic and set a most vicious precedent." <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Immediately on this the two Carvilii dropped the
                        proposal for a fine and indicted Postumius for high treason, and ordered him
                        to find sureties for his appearance on the day of trial, or failing that to
                        be at once arrested and taken to prison. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                        He found sureties, but did not appear. The resolution proposed by the
                        tribunes and adopted by the plebs was in the following terms: "If M.
                        Postumius does not enter an appearance before the first day of May and when

                        There were three candidates: Q. Fulvius Flaccus, the consul, who had

                        years, with the sole exception of P. Cornelius Calussa, who had been elected

                            unit="section"/> The consuls found the levying of troops a difficult
                        task, for there were not sufficient men of the required age to answer both
                        purposes, that of raising the new City legions and also bringing the

                        The senate, however, would not allow them to give up the attempt, and
                        ordered two commissions, each consisting of three members, to be appointed,

                        are capturing some cities, the Romans are taking others, infantry and

                        as their reward freedom and citizenship, we implore you to treat us at least
                        as slaves who have been purchased for this war, and to allow us to meet and
                        fight the enemy and so win our freedom. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>

                        soldiers who had deserted their comrades at Cannae. If M. Claudius, the

                        on Italian soil. After this an election was held by the City praetor, in

                        three members, were selected; one to inspect the contents of the temples and

                        storms occurred: on the Alban Mount it rained stones incessantly for two
                        days. Many places were struck by lightning, two buildings in the Capitol,
                        the rampart of the camp above Suessula in many places, two sentinels being
                        killed. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The wall and some of the towers at
                        Cumae were not only struck, but even thrown down by the lightning. At Reate
                        a huge rock was seen to fly about, and the sun was unusually red, in fact
                        the colour of blood. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> By reason of these
                        portents a day was set apart for special intercessions, and for several days
                        the consuls devoted their attention to religious matters, and special
                        services were held for nine days. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The
                        betrayal of Tarentum had long been an object of hope with Hannibal and of
                        suspicion with the Romans, and now an incident which occurred outside its
                        walls hastened its capture. Phileas had been a long time in Rome, ostensibly
                        as the Tarentine envoy. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He was a restless
                        character and chafed under the inaction in which he seemed likely to spend
                        the greater part of his life. The hostages from Tarentum and Thurii were
                        kept in the Hall of Liberty, but not under strict surveillance, because it
                        was neither for their own interest nor for that of their city to play the
                        Romans false. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Phileas found means of
                        access to them and had frequent interviews, in which he won them over to his
                        design, and by bribing two of the watchmen he brought them <milestone

                        they made their secret escape from Rome. As soon as it was light their
                        flight became known throughout the City, and a party was sent in pursuit.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> They were caught at Tarracina and
                        brought back; then they were marched into the Comitium and, with the

                        feeling of bitter resentment in the two most important Greek cities in
                        Italy, not only amongst the population <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/>
                        at large, but especially amongst those who were connected by ties of
                        relationship or friendship with the men who had met with such a horrible
                        fate. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Amongst these there were thirteen
                        young nobles of Tarentum who entered into a conspiracy; the ringleaders were
                        Nico and Philemenus. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Before taking any
                        action they thought that they ought to have an interview with Hannibal. They
                        left the city by night on the presence that they were going on a hunting
                        expedition and took the direction of his camp. <milestone n="5"

                        themselves in a wood near the road while Nico and Philemenus went on to the
                        outposts. They were seized, as they intended to be, and were conducted to
                        Hannibal. After explaining to him the motives which had prompted them and
                        the nature of the step they were contemplating they were warmly thanked and
                        loaded with promises, and Hannibal advised them to drive to the city some
                        cattle belonging to the Carthaginians which had been turned out to pasture,
                        so that they might make their fellow-townsmen believe that they had really
                        gone out, as they said, to get plunder. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He
                        promised that they should be safe and unmolested while so engaged.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Every one saw the plunder which the
                        young men had brought, and as they did the same thing over and over again
                        people wondered less at their daring. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At
                        their next interview with Hannibal they obtained from him a solemn promise
                        that the Tarentines should preserve their freedom and retain their own laws
                        and all that belonged to them, they were to pay no taxes or tribute to
                        Carthage, nor be required to admit a Carthaginian garrison against their
                        will. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The Roman garrison was to be at the
                        mercy of the Carthaginians. When this understanding had been arrived at,
                        Philemenus made a regular habit of leaving the city and returning to it by
                        night. He was noted for his passion for hunting and he had his dogs and
                        other requisites for the sport with him. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                        Generally he brought back something which had purposely been placed in his
                        way and gave it either to the commanders or the men on guard. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> They imagined that he chose night time for his
                        expeditions through fear of the enemy. When they had become so accustomed to

                        the signal by whistling, Hannibal thought the time had come for action.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He was three days' march distant, and
                        in order to lessen any surprise that might be felt at his remaining encamped

                            unit="section"/> The Romans who were garrisoning Tarentum had ceased to

                        Tarentum, he picked out a force of 10,000 infantry and cavalry, who, from
                        their agility and the lightness of their armour, would be most suitable for
                        a dash upon the city. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At the fourth watch
                        of the night he made his advance and sent forward about eighty Numidian
                        troopers with orders to patrol the roads in the neighbourhood and keep a
                        sharp look out so that none of the rustics might espy his movements from a
                        distance. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Those in front of them they were
                        to bring back, any whom they met they were to kill in order that the
                        inhabitants of the district might take them for a marauding force rather
                        than an army. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Marching his men rapidly
                        forward he encamped about fifteen miles from Tarentum, and without saving a
                        word as to where they were going he called his men together and warned them
                        all to keep in the line of march and not to allow any one to fall out or
                        leave the ranks. They were above all things to listen to orders with
                        attention and not to do anything that they were not told to do. <milestone
                            n="5" unit="section"/> He would tell them, when the time came, what he
                        wanted them to do. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Almost at the same hour
                        a rumour reached Tarentum that a small body of Numidian horse were ravaging
                        their fields and creating a panic far and wide amongst the peasantry. This
                        news did not disturb the Roman commandant farther than that he ordered a
                        portion of his cavalry to ride out the next morning early to drive off the
                        enemy. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> As to guarding against any other
                        contingency, so little care was shown that this movement on the part of the
                        Numidians was actually taken as a proof that Hannibal and his army had not
                        stirred from their camp. </p>

                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Hannibal resumed his advance soon after
                        dark; Philemenus leading the way with the usual load of game on his
                        shoulders, the rest of the conspirators waiting inside the town to carry out
                        their part in the plot. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The arrangement
                        was that Philemenus should carry his prey through the wicket gate which he
                        always used and at the same time admit some armed men; Hannibal was to
                        approach the Temenide gate from another direction. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> This gate was on the landward part of the city and
                        looked eastwards near the public cemetery inside the walls. As he approached
                        the gate Hannibal gave the signal by showing a light, the signal was
                        answered in the same way by Nico; then both lights were extinguished.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Hannibal marched up to the gate in
                        silence; Nico made a sudden attack upon the sentinels who were sleeping
                        soundly in their beds and killed them, then he opened the gate. <milestone
                            n="12" unit="section"/> Hannibal entered with his infantry, but the
                        cavalry were ordered to remain outside, ready to meet any attack in the open
                        plain. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> In the other direction Philemenus
                        also reached the wicket gate which he had been in the habit of using, and
                        whilst he was calling out that they could hardly stand the weight of the
                        huge beast they were carrying, his voice and well-known signal roused the
                        sentry and the gate was opened. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Two young
                        men carrying a wild boar entered, Philemenus and a lightly equipped huntsman
                        followed close after, and whilst the sentinel, astonished at its size,
                        turned unsuspectingly towards those who were carrying it, Philemenus ran him
                        through with a hunting spear. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Then about
                        thirty armed men ran in and massacred the rest of the sentinels and broke
                        open the large gate adjoining and the army at once entered in fighting order
                        and marched in perfect silence to the forum where they joined Hannibal.
                            <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> The Carthaginian general formed 2000
                        of his Gauls into three divisions, furnishing each with Tarentines to guide
                        them, and sent them into different parts of the city with orders to occupy
                        the main streets, and if a tumult arose they were to cut down the Romans and
                        spare the townsfolk. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> To secure this
                        latter object he gave instructions to the conspirators to tell any of their

                        thought that the Roman garrison had started to pillage the town; the Romans
                        were under the impression that the townsfolk had got up a disturbance with
                        some treacherous design. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The commandant,
                        awakened by the tumult, hurried away to the harbour, and getting into a boat

                        the confusion the sound of a trumpet was heard from the theatre. It was a
                        Roman trumpet which the conspirators had procured for the purpose, and being

                        Carthaginians and Gauls, and all doubt was removed; the Greeks, too, seeing
                        the bodies of the Romans lying about everywhere, became aware that the city
                        had been taken by Hannibal. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> When the light
                        grew clearer and the Romans who survived the massacre had taken refuge in
                        the citadel, the tumult having somewhat subsided, Hannibal ordered the

                        After they had all assembled, with the exception of those who had

                        might be, Hannibal addressed some kind words to them, and reminded them of
                        the way he had treated their compatriots whom he had taken in the battle of
                        Cannae. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He went on to inveigh bitterly
                        against the tyranny of Roman domination, and ended by ordering them each to

                        The people were dismissed, and after the inscriptions had been placed on the

                        the signal was given and the troops dispersed in all directions to plunder
                        the Roman houses. There was a considerable amount of plunder seized. </p>

                        citadel. It was protected by lofty cliffs on the side of the sea which
                        surrounded the greater part of it like a peninsula, and on the side of the
                        city it was enclosed by a wall and a very deep moat; Hannibal saw at once
                        that it could successfully defy any attack either by storm or by siege
                        works. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> As he did not wish to be delayed
                        from undertaking more important operations by having to protect the
                        Tarentines nor to leave them without adequate defence against any attacks
                        which the Romans might make at their pleasure from the citadel, he decided
                        to cut off communication between the city and the citadel by earthworks.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He rather hoped, too, that the Romans
                        might attempt to interfere whilst these were being constructed and give him
                        a chance of fighting, and in case they made a sortie in force he might
                        inflict such heavy loss upon them and so weaken them that the Tarentines
                        could easily hold their own against them unaided. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> No sooner was the work commenced than the Romans
                        suddenly flung open the citadel gates and attacked the working party. The
                        detachment who were on guard along the front allowed themselves to be driven
                        in, and the Romans, emboldened by success, followed them up in greater
                        numbers and to a greater distance. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then a
                        signal was given and the Carthaginians whom Hannibal had drawn up in
                        readiness rushed upon them from all sides. The Romans could not withstand
                        their attack, but their flight was checked by the narrow space and the
                        obstructions caused by the work which had been begun and the preparations
                        made for continuing it. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> A great many flung
                        themselves headlong into the fosse, and more were killed in the flight than
                        in the fighting. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After this the work
                        proceeded without molestation. An enormous fosse was dug and on its inner
                        side a breastwork and parapet thrown up, and a little further off in the
                        same direction he made preparations for adding a wall, so that the town
                        could protect itself against the Romans without his aid. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> He left, however, a small detachment to garrison the
                        place and also help to complete the wall, while he himself with the rest of
                        his force fixed his camp by the river Galaesus about five miles from
                        Tarentum. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Returning from this position to
                        inspect the work, and finding it much more advanced than he expected, he
                        became hopeful of successfully attacking the citadel. It was not, like other
                        similar places, protected by its lofty position, as it stood on level ground
                        and was separated from the city by a moat and a wall. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> While the attack was being pressed with siege works,
                        machines, and artillery of every kind, reinforcements arrived from
                        Metapontum, and thus strengthened, the Romans were encouraged to make a
                        night attack upon the enemies' works. Some they broke up, others they burnt,
                        and that was the end of Hannibal's attempts to storm the walls. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> His only hope now was to invest the citadel, but
                        that seemed useless, for standing as it did on a promontory and overlooking
                        the mouth of the harbour, those who held it could make free use of the sea.
                        The city, on the other hand, was cut off from all sea-borne supplies, and
                        the besiegers were more likely to starve than the besieged. </p>

                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Hannibal called the principal men of the
                        place together and explained all the difficulties of the situation. He told
                        them that he saw no way of carrying a citadel so strongly fortified by
                        storm, and there was nothing to hope for from a blockade as long as the
                        enemy were masters of the sea. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> If he had
                        ships, so that all supplies could be stopped from reaching them, they would
                        then have to evacuate the citadel or surrender. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> The Tarentines quite agreed with him, but they thought
                        that the man who gave the advice ought to help in carrying it out.
                            <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> If he sent for Carthaginian vessels
                        from Sicily the thing could be done, but their own ships were locked up in a
                        narrow bay; so how could they escape into the open sea as long as the enemy
                        held the mouth of the harbour? <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> "They
                        shall escape," Hannibal replied. "Many things which nature makes difficult
                        become easy to the man who uses his brains. You have a city situated in a
                        flat country; broad and level roads lead in all directions. <milestone
                            n="17" unit="section"/> I will transport your ships without much trouble
                        on wagons and along the road which leads from the harbour through the heart
                        of the city to the sea. Then the sea which the enemy are now masters of will
                        be ours, we shall invest the citadel by sea on the one side, by land on the
                        other, or rather I would say we shall very soon capture it, either after the
                        enemy have evacuated it or with the enemy inside as well." <milestone n="18"
                            unit="section"/> These words excited not only hopes of success but also
                        an intense feeling of admiration for the general. Wagons were speedily
                        collected from all sides and fastened together; machines were employed for
                        hauling the ships ashore, and the surface of the road was made good so that
                        the wagons could be drawn more easily and the transport effected with less
                        difficulty. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Then draught animals and men
                        were got together, and the work promptly began. After a few days a
                        completely equipped fleet sailed round the citadel and cast anchor off the
                        very mouth of the harbour. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> Such was the
                        condition of affairs which Hannibal left behind him at Tarentum when he
                        returned to his winter quarters. Authorities, however, are divided on the
                        question whether the defection of Tarentum occurred this year or last, but
                        the majority, including those who lived nearest to the time of the events,
                        assert that it happened this year. </p>

                        of M. Aemilius who, as City praetor, was in charge of the business, and he

                        people of Capua were plentifully supplied with corn. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Hanno accordingly marched into Campania and, carefully
                        avoiding the consuls who were both encamped in Samnium, he selected a
                        position for his camp on some rising ground about three miles from
                        Beneventum. He then issued orders for the corn which had been stored in the
                        friendly cities round to be carried to his camp, and assigned detachments to
                        guard the convoys. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> A message was
                        despatched to Capua stating the day on which they were to appear in the camp
                        to receive the corn, bringing with them all the vehicles and beasts they
                        could collect. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Campanians carried out
                        his instructions with the same slackness and carelessness that they showed
                        in everything else. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Hardly more than four
                        hundred country carts were sent and a few draught cattle. Hanno scolded them
                        severely, telling them that even the hunger which rouses the energies of
                        dumb animals failed to stimulate them to exertion. He then fixed another day
                        for them to come for corn provided with much more efficient means of
                        transport. </p>
                    <p> Everything was reported to the people of Beneventum exactly as it happened.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> They at once sent a deputation of ten
                        of their principal citizens to the consuls, both of whom were near Bovianum.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On hearing what was going on at Capua
                        they arranged that one of them should march into Campania. Fulvius, to whom
                        that province had been assigned, made a night march and entered Beneventum.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> He was now in Hanno's immediate
                        neighbourhood and was informed that he had left with a portion of his army
                        on a foraging expedition, that corn was supplied to Capua under the
                        superintendence of the head of his commissariat, that two thousand wagons
                        with a disorderly and unarmed crowd had arrived at his camp, that haste and
                        confusion prevailed everywhere, and that the rustics had invaded the camp
                        from all the country round and destroyed all semblance of military order and
                        all chance of military discipline. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> When
                        he had satisfied himself that this information was correct, he issued an
                        order for his men to get ready their standards and arms against
                        nightfall-and nothing else-as they would have to attack the Carthaginian
                        camp. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Leaving their kits and all their
                        baggage in Beneventum, they started at the fourth watch and reached the camp
                        just before dawn. Their appearance created such alarm that, had the camp
                        been on level ground, it could undoubtedly have been carried at the first
                        assault. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Its elevated position and its
                        entrenchments saved it; in no direction could it be approached except by
                        steep and difficult climbing. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> When day
                        broke a hot fight commenced; the Carthaginians did not confine themselves to
                        defending their lines; but being on more even ground themselves they threw
                        down the enemy who were struggling up the heights. </p>

                        all difficulties, and in some places the Romans had forced their way to the
                        breastwork and fosse, but with heavy loss in killed and wounded, when the
                        consul, calling round him the superior officers, told them that they must
                        desist from the hazardous attempt. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He
                        thought it would be wiser to march back to Beneventum for that day, and on
                        the next day to bring their camp close up to the enemy's camp, so that the
                        Campanians could not quit it and Hanno would be unable to return to it.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> To make more certain of this, he
                        prepared to send for his colleague and his army and direct their joint
                        operations against Hanno and the Campanians. The "retire" was already being
                        sounded when the general's plans were shattered by the angry shouts of the
                        soldiers who spurned such feeble tactics. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        The Paelignian cohort happened to be in closest touch with the enemy, and
                        their commanding officer, Vibius Accaus, snatched <milestone n="5??"
                            unit="section"/> up a standard and flung it across the enemies' rampart,
                        at the same time invoking a curse on himself and his cohort if the enemy got
                        possession of the standard. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He was the
                        first to dash over fosse and rampart into the camp. Now the Paelignians were
                        fighting inside the lines, and Valerius Flaccus, the commanding officer of
                        the third legion, was rating the Romans for their cowardice in letting the
                        allies have the glory of capturing the camp, when T. Pedanius, a centurion
                        in command of the leading maniples' took a standard out of the bearer's
                        hands and shouted, "This standard <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> and
                        this centurion will be inside the rampart in a moment, let those follow who
                        will prevent its capture by the enemy." <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                        His own maniples followed him as he sprang across the fosse, then the whole
                        of the legion pressed hard after. By this time even the consul, when he saw
                        them climbing over the rampart, changed his mind, and instead of recalling
                        the troops began to urge them on by pointing to the dangerous position of
                        their gallant allies and their own fellow citizens. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> Every man did his best to push on; over smooth and
                        rough ground alike, amidst missiles showered upon them from all directions,
                        against the desperate resistance of the enemy who thrust their persons and
                        their weapons in the way, they advanced step by step and broke into the
                        camp. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Many who were wounded, even those
                        who were faint from loss of blood, struggled on that they might fall within
                        the enemies' camp. In this way the camp was taken, and taken too as quickly
                        as though it lay on level ground, entirely unfortified. It was no longer a
                        fight but a massacre, for they were all crowded together inside the lines.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Over l0,000 of the enemy were killed
                        and over 7000 made prisoners, including the Campanians who had come for
                        corn, and all the wagons and draught animals were captured. <milestone
                            n="12" unit="section"/> There was also an immense quantity of plunder
                        which Hanno, who had been raiding everywhere, had carried off from the
                        fields of the allies of Rome. After totally destroying the enemies' camp
                        they returned to Beneventum. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> There the
                        two consuls-Appius Claudius had arrived a few days before-sold and
                        distributed the spoil. Those to whose exertions the capture of the camp was
                        due were rewarded, especially Accaus the Paelignian and T. Pedanius the
                        centurion who headed the first legion. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        Hanno was at Cominium-Ocritum with a small foraging party when he heard of
                        the disaster to his camp, and he retreated to Bruttium in a way which
                        suggested flight rather than an orderly march. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When the Campanians, in their turn, heard
                        of the disaster which had overtaken them and their allies, they sent to
                        Hannibal to inform him that the two consuls were at Beneventum, a day's
                        march from Capua, and that the war had all but reached their walls and
                        gates. If he did not come with all speed to their help Capua would fall into
                        the hands of the enemy more rapidly than Arpi had done. <milestone n="2"
                            unit="section"/> Not even Tarentum, much less its citadel, ought to be
                        of so much importance in his eyes as to make him give up to Rome, abandoned
                        and defenceless, the Capua which he always used to say was as great as
                        Carthage. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Hannibal promised that he would
                        take care of Capua, and sent a force of 2000 cavalry by whose aid they would
                        be able to keep their fields from being devastated. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> The Romans, meanwhile, amongst their other cares, had
                        not lost sight of the citadel of Tarentum and its beleaguered garrison. P.
                        Cornelius, one of the praetors, had, acting on the instructions of the
                        senate, sent his lieutenant, C. Servilius, to purchase corn in Etruria, and
                        after loading some ships sailed to Tarentum and made his way through the
                        enemies' guard ships into the harbour. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> His
                        arrival produced such a change that the very men who, having lost almost all
                        hope, had been frequently invited by the enemy in their colloquies with them
                        to go over to them, now actually invited and tried to persuade the enemy to
                        come over to them. Soldiers, too, had been sent from Metapontum, so the
                        garrison was now strong enough for the defence of the citadel. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> The Metapontines, on the other hand, relieved
                        from their fears by the departure of the Romans, promptly went over to
                        Hannibal. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The people of Thurii, on the
                        same part of the coast, took the same step. Their action was due in some
                        measure to the defection of Tarentum and Metapontum, but it was due quite as
                        much to their feeling of exasperation against the Romans at the recent
                        massacre of their hostages. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It was the
                        relations and friends of these who sent messengers with despatches to
                        Hannibal and Mago, who were in the neighbourhood, promising to put the city
                        in their power if they would march up to the walls. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> M. Atinius was in command at Thurii with a small
                        garrison, and they thought that he would easily be drawn into a precipitate
                        engagement, not because he trusted to his own small garrison, but because he
                        relied upon the soldiery of Thurii, whom he had carefully drilled and armed
                        against such an emergency. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> After the Carthaginian generals had
                        entered the country of Thurii they divided their forces: Hanno proceeded
                        with the infantry in battle order up to the city; Mago and his cavalry
                        halted and took up a position behind some hills admirably adapted for
                        concealing his movements. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Atinius
                        understood from his scouts that the hostile force consisted entirely of
                        infantry, accordingly he went into battle quite unaware of the treachery of
                        the citizens or the maneuver of the enemy. <milestone n="12" unit="section"
                        /> The contest was a very spiritless one, only a few Romans were in the
                        fighting line, and the Thurians were awaiting the issue rather than helping
                        to decide it. The Carthaginian line purposely fell back in order to draw
                        their unsuspecting enemy behind the hill where the cavalry were waiting. No
                        sooner had they reached the place than the cavalry dashed forward with their
                        battle cry. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The Thurians, an
                        ill-disciplined crowd, disloyal to the side on which they fought, were at
                        once put to flight; the Romans kept up the fight for some time in spite of
                        their being attacked on one side by the infantry and on the other by the
                        cavalry, but at last they, too, turned and fled to the city. <milestone
                            n="14" unit="section"/> There a body of the traitors admitted the stream
                        of their fellow townsmen through the open gate, but when they saw the Romans
                        routed and <milestone n="15??" unit="section"/> running towards the city
                        they shouted that the Carthaginians were at their heels and the enemy would
                        enter the city pell mell with the Romans unless they instantly closed the
                        gates. The Romans accordingly were shut out for slaughter by the enemy,
                        Atinius and a few others being alone allowed to enter. <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> A heated discussion thereupon arose amongst the
                        townsmen; some were for maintaining their loyalty to Rome, others thought
                        they ought to yield to fate and surrender the city to the victors.
                            <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> As usual, evil counsels and the
                        desire to be on the winning side carried the day. Atinius and his men were
                        conducted down to the sea and placed on board ship, not because they were
                        Romans, but because, after Atinius' mild and impartial administration, they
                        wished to provide for his safety. Then the Carthaginians were admitted into
                        the city. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> The consuls left Beneventum and
                        marched their legions into the territory of Capua, partly to destroy the
                        crops of corn which were now in the blade, and partly with the view of
                        making an attack upon the city. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> They
                        thought that they would make their consulship illustrious by the destruction
                        of so wealthy and prosperous a city and at the same time they would wipe out
                        a great stain from the republic which had allowed the defection of so close
                        a neighbour to go for three years unpunished. They could not, however, leave
                        Beneventum unguarded. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> If, as they felt
                        certain would be the case, Hannibal came to Capua to help his friends, it
                        would be necessary, in view of the sudden emergency, to provide against the
                        attacks of his cavalry. They sent orders, therefore, to Tiberius Gracchus,
                        who was in Lucania, to come to Beneventum with his cavalry and light
                        infantry, and to leave some one in command of the legions in the standing
                        camp who were protecting Lucania. </p>

                        offered and the parts reserved with greater care, but according to the

                        slipped away untouched. The augurs warned the commander that the portent
                        concerned him and they bade him be on his guard against secret foes and
                        secret plots. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But no foresight could avert
                        the impending doom. There was a Lucanian named Flavus, the head of that
                        section of the Lucanians who stood by Rome-one section had gone over to
                        Hannibal-and they elected him praetor. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> He
                        had already been a year in office when suddenly he changed his mind and
                        began to look out for an opportunity of ingratiating himself with the
                        Carthaginians. He did not think it enough to go over himself and draw the
                        Lucanians with him into revolt, unless he could make his league with the
                        enemy sure by the life-blood of the very man who was his guest-friend, and
                        betray the Roman commander. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> He had a
                        secret interview with Mago, who was commanding in Bruttium, and obtained his
                        solemn pledge that if he would betray the Roman commander to the
                        Carthaginians the Lucanians should be taken into friendship and allowed to
                        live as a free people under their own laws. <milestone n="8" unit="section"
                        /> He then took Mago to the spot where he said he would bring Gracchus with
                        a small escort. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Mago was to bring foot and
                        horse fully armed to the place and place a large force in concealment. After
                        the spot had been thoroughly examined and an investigation made of every
                        part, a day was fixed for carrying out the project. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Flavus went to the Roman commander and told him that he
                        had an important enterprise on hand and required Gracchus' help for its
                        accomplishment. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> He had persuaded the
                        chief magistrates of all the communities which in the general disturbance of
                        Italy had seceded to the Carthaginians to return to friendship with Rome,
                        since the cause of Rome which had been all but ruined at Cannae was every
                        day becoming stronger and more popular, whilst the strength of Hannibal was
                        waning and had almost reached the vanishing point. <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> The Romans, he knew, would not be implacable to those
                        who had formerly offended, there had never been a nation more ready to
                        listen to prayers and more quick to grant forgiveness. <milestone n="13"

                        after their repeated renewal of hostilities! This was the language he had
                        addressed to them. "But," he went on, "they would rather hear all this from
                        Gracchus himself in person, and touch his right hand, and carry away with
                        them that pledge of good faith." <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> He
                        explained that he had mentioned a place to those whom he had taken into
                        confidence not far from the Roman camp, and only a few words would be needed
                        so to arrange matters there that the entire Lucanian nation would become
                        faithful allies of Rome. </p>

                            unit="section"/> He rode straight into the snare; suddenly enemies
                        showed themselves on all sides, and to take away all doubt as to his being
                        betrayed Flavus joined them. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Missiles
                        were hurled from every quarter upon Gracchus and his cavalry. <milestone
                            n="18" unit="section"/> He sprung from his horse, and ordered the rest
                        to do the same, and called upon them to make the one thing which Fortune had
                        left them glorious by their courage. "For what is left," he cried, "to a
                        little band surrounded by an enormous host in a valley shut in by forest and

                        awaiting the end and make a fierce and furious onslaught, doing and daring,

                        the enemy. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> There was more fighting than
                        might have been expected from the number of the combatants. The Romans were
                        most exposed to the darts, and as they were hurled from the higher ground
                        all round they were pierced by them. <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                        Gracchus was now left without any defence and the Carthaginians tried to
                        take him alive, but catching sight of his Lucanian guest-friend amongst the
                        enemy, he made such a furious onslaught on their serried ranks that it
                        became impossible to save his life without incurring heavy loss. <milestone
                            n="24" unit="section"/> Mago sent his dead body to Hannibal and ordered
                        it and the captured fasces to be placed before the general's tribunal.

                        generally accepted account. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> According to
                        this version, a funeral pyre was erected on the open space in front of the

                        Spanish dances and the movements of limbs and weapons peculiar to each
                        tribe, Hannibal doing honour to the dead in every way by his acts and words.

                        heart into the Romans and lessened the confidence of the other side, an
                        insignificant one it is true, but in war nothing is so insignificant as not
                        sometimes to involve serious consequences. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        T. Quinctius Crispinus had a friend in Capua called Badius, and their
                        friendship was a very close and intimate one. The intimacy had been formed
                        before the defection of Capua when Badius was lying ill in Rome at
                        Crispinus' house and received the kindest and most careful attention from
                        his host. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> One day this Badius walked up to
                        the sentinels on duty before the camp gate and asked them to call Crispinus.
                        Crispinus, on receiving the message, imagined that he had not forgotten the
                        old ties of friendship even though public treaties were torn up, and that he
                        wanted a friendly and familiar talk, and accordingly he went on a short

                        they came in sight of one another Badius called out: "I, Badius, challenge
                        you, Crispinus, to battle. Let us mount our horses and, when the others have
                        withdrawn, decide who of us is the better fighter." <milestone n="7"

                        lacked enemies upon whom they could display their courage, but as for
                        himself, even if he met Badius on the field of battle, he would avoid him
                        sooner than pollute his right hand with a friend's blood. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Then he turned round and was in the act of departing
                        when Badius became more insolent and began to taunt him with effeminacy and
                        cowardice and hurled at him abusive epithets which he himself more properly
                        deserved. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He said that he was an enemy

                        states together were broken the bonds of private friendship were not broken
                        at the same time, then he, Badius of Capua, openly renounced in the hearing
                        of both armies the friendship of T. Quinctius Crispinus the Roman.

                        with impunity, and so, only waiting till he could ask his commanders if they
                        would allow him, against regulations, to fight an enemy who challenged him,

                        no hesitation; they spurred their horses against each other and met.

                        by different routes, Hannibal was at first undecided which he should follow;
                        he decided to follow Appius. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> After leading
                        his enemy about just as he pleased, Appius returned by a circuitous route to
                        Capua. </p>
                    <p> Another chance of achieving success in this country presented itself to
                        Hannibal. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> There was a certain M.
                        Centenius, surnamed Paenula, who was conspicuous among the centurions of the
                        first rank for his physical stature and his courage. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> After completing his period of service he was
                        introduced by P. Cornelius Sulla, the praetor, to the senate. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> He requested the senators to allow him 5000 men;
                        he was well acquainted with the enemy and the country where he was operating
                        and would very soon do something worth the doing; the tactics by which our
                        generals and their armies had been outwitted up to that time he would employ
                        against the man who invented them. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Stupid
                        as the promise was it was quite as stupidly given credence to, as though the
                        qualifications of a soldier were the same as those of a general. <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> Instead of 5000 he was given 8000 men, half of
                        them Romans and half troops furnished by the allies. He himself, too, picked
                        up a considerable number of volunteers in the country through which he was
                        marching, and he arrived in Lucania with double the army he started with.
                        Here Hannibal had come to a halt after his fruitless pursuit of Claudius.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The result could not be doubtful,
                        seeing it was a contest between armies one of which consisted of veterans
                        habituated to victory, the other a hastily raised and half-armed force.
                            <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> As soon as they caught sight of each
                        other, neither side declined battle and they at once got into fighting
                        order. For more than two hours, however, in spite of the utterly unequal
                        conditions, the Roman army kept up the fighting as long as their leader
                        stood his ground. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> At last, out of regard
                        for his former reputation and also fearing the disgrace he would incur if he
                        survived a defeat brought on by his own headlong folly, he rushed upon the
                        weapons of the foe and fell, and the Roman army was instantly routed.
                            <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> But even when they fled they found no
                        way of escape, for all avenues were closed by the cavalry, so that out of
                        that multitude of men only a thousand escaped, all the rest perished in one
                        way or another. </p>

                        in earnest, and everything necessary for the task was brought together and
                        got into readiness. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Corn was stored at
                        Casilinum; at the mouth of the Vulturnus, where the town of Vulturnum now
                        stands, a fort was constructed and a garrison was placed in it and in
                        Puteoli also, which Fabius had previously fortified, so that they might
                        command both the river and the adjacent sea. <milestone n="3" unit="section"

                        M. Junius had purchased in Etruria was conveyed from Ostia into these two
                        maritime fortresses, that the army might have a supply throughout the
                        winter. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Meantime the disaster which had
                        overtaken Centenius in Lucania was aggravated by another which resulted from
                        the death of Gracchus. The volunteer slaves who had done excellent service
                        when he was alive to lead them, looked upon his death as discharging them
                        from further military duties and accordingly disbanded themselves.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Hannibal was anxious not to neglect
                        Capua or desert friends who were in such a critical position, but after his
                        easy victory through the foolhardiness of one Roman general he was watching
                        for an opportunity of crushing another. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        Envoys from Apulia had informed him that Cn. Fulvius, who was attacking some
                        of their cities which had seceded to him, had at first conducted his
                        operations with care and prudence, but afterwards, intoxicated with success
                        and loaded with plunder, he and his men had given themselves up to such
                        idleness and self-indulgence that all military discipline had disappeared.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Hannibal knew by repeated experience,
                        and especially within the last few days, what state an army gets into under
                        an incompetent commander and he at once moved into Apulia. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Fulvius and his legions were in the
                        neighbourhood of Heraclea. When they heard that the enemy were approaching
                        they were almost on the point of dragging up the standards and going into
                        battle without waiting for orders. In fact the one thing that restrained
                        them more than anything else was the confidence they felt of being able to
                        choose their own time for fighting. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                        following night, when Hannibal became aware that the camp was in a state of
                        tumult and that most of the men were defying their commander and insisting
                        that he should give the signal, and that there was a general cry, "To arms!"
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> he was quite certain that the
                        opportunity was presented of a successful battle. He quietly disposed some
                        three thousand of his light infantry in the surrounding homesteads and in
                        the woods and copses. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They were all to
                        spring from their concealment at the same moment when the signal was given,
                        and Mago had orders to place about two thousand cavalry along all the roads
                        which he thought the direction of the flight might take. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> After making these dispositions during the night, he
                        marched out to battle at dawn. Fulvius did not hesitate, though he was not
                        drawn on so much by any hopes of success on his own part as by the blind
                        impetuosity of his men. The same recklessness which sent them on to the
                        field appeared in the formation of their line. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> They went forward in a haphazard way and took their
                        places in the ranks just where they chose, and left them again as their
                        caprices or fears dictated. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The first
                        legion and the left wing of the allies were drawn up in front and the line
                        was extended far beyond its proper length. The officers called out that it
                        possessed neither strength nor depth and wherever the enemy made their
                        attack they would break through, but the men would not even listen to, much
                        less attend to anything that was for their good. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> And now Hannibal was upon them; a general so different
                        from their own, with an army so different and in such different order!
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As might be expected, the Romans were
                        unable to withstand the very first attack; their general, quite as foolish
                        and reckless as Centenius, though not to be compared with him in courage, no
                        sooner saw the day going against him and his men in confusion than he seized
                        a horse and made his escape with about two hundred of his cavalry.
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The rest of the army, repulsed in
                        front and then surrounded in rear and flanks, was so completely cut up that

                        another, created very great grief and alarm amongst the citizens in Rome,

                        was most important, they were not so much disturbed by the tidings as they
                        might have been. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The senate despatched C.
                        Laetorius and M. Metilius with instructions to the consuls, telling them to
                        carefully get together the remains of the two armies and to see to it that
                        the survivors were not driven by fear and despair to surrender to the enemy,
                        as had happened after the disaster at Cannae. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> They were also to find out who had deserted amongst the
                        volunteer slaves. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Publius Cornelius also
                        was charged with this latter task, as he was with the raising of fresh
                        troops, and he caused notices to be published through the market-towns and
                        boroughs, ordering that search should be made for the volunteer slaves, and
                        that they should be brought back to their standards. These instructions were
                        all most carefully carried out. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Appius
                        Claudius placed D. Junius in command at the mouth of the Vulturnus, and M.
                        Aurelius Cotta at Puteoli; whenever the vessels arrived from Etruria and
                        Sardinia they were at once to have the corn sent on to the camp. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> Claudius then returned to Capua and found his
                        colleague Q. Fulvius bringing everything from Casilinum and making
                        preparations to attack the city. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Both of
                        them now commenced the investment of the place, and they summoned the
                        praetor, Claudius Nero, who was in Claudius' old camp at Suessula.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> He, too, leaving a small force to hold
                        the position, came down with the rest of his army to Capua. So three
                        commanders had their headquarters now established round Capua, and three
                        armies working on different sides were preparing to ring the city round with
                        fosse and dyke. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They erected blockhouses
                        at certain intervals, and battles took place in several places at once with
                        the Campanians as they tried to stop the work, the result being that at last
                        the Campanians kept within their walls and gates. </p>

                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Before, however, the circle of investment
                        was completed, envoys were despatched to Hannibal to remonstrate with him
                        for having abandoned Capua which was now almost restored to the Romans, and
                        to implore him to bring them succour now, at all events, as they were no
                        longer merely besieged but completely blockaded. <milestone n="11"
                            unit="section"/> A despatch was sent to the consuls by P. Cornelius
                        bidding them give an opportunity to the inhabitants, before they completed
                        the investment, of leaving the place and carrying away their property with
                        them. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Those who left before the 15th of
                        March would be free and remain in possession of all their property; after
                        that date those who left and those who remained would be alike treated as
                        enemies. When this offer was announced to the Campanians they treated it not
                        only with scorn but with gratuitous insults and threats as well. <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> Shortly before this Hannibal had left Herdonea
                        for Tarentum in the hope of acquiring the place either by treachery or by
                        force, and as he failed to do so he bent his course towards Brundisium,
                        under the impression that the town would surrender. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> It was whilst he was spending time here to no purpose
                        that the envoys from Capua came to him with their remonstrances and appeals.
                            <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Hannibal answered them in
                        high-sounding words; "he had raised the siege of Capua once already, and the
                        consuls would not wait for his approach even now." <milestone n="16"
                            unit="section"/> Dismissed with this hope the envoys had considerable
                        difficulty in getting back to Capua, surrounded as it now was with a double

                            unit="section"/> This result was due in a large measure to the energy
                        and courage of the general and his army, but it had been helped on by
                        domestic treachery. At the commencement of the spring Marcellus was
                        undecided whether to turn the stress of war to Agrigentum against Himilco
                        and Hippocrates, or whether he should press the siege of Syracuse.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> He saw that this place could not be
                        carried by assault, as it was unassailable by sea or land owing to its
                        position, nor could it be reduced by famine, since it was nourished by a
                        free supply of provisions from Carthage. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        However, he determined to leave nothing untried. There were with the Romans
                        some leading members of the Syracusan nobility who had been expelled when
                        the defection took place, and Marcellus told these refugees to sound the
                        feelings of the men of their own party, and give them an assurance that if
                        Syracuse were surrendered they should be free and live under their own laws.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> It was impossible to get any chance of
                        interviews, for the fact of many being suspected made all more careful and
                        watchful, so that no attempt of the kind should escape detection. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> A slave belonging to the exiles was admitted into
                        the city as a deserter, and after getting a few men together, broached the
                        subject in conversation. Subsequently some were hidden under the nets in a
                        fishing boat and in that way taken round to the Roman camp where they had
                        conversations with the refugees. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Different
                        people, one after another, did the same thing, until at last there were as
                        many as eighty concerned in the matter. When all the arrangements for
                        surrender had been made, information was given to Epicydes by a certain
                        Attalus who resented not having been intrusted with the secret, and they
                        were all tortured to death. </p>
                    <p> This hope, which had proved so illusory, was soon succeeded by another.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> A certain Damippus, a Lacedaemonian,
                        had been sent from Syracuse on a mission to King Philip and was captured by
                        some Roman ships. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Epicydes was
                        particularly anxious to ransom this man, and Marcellus raised no objection,
                        as just at that time the Romans were bidding for the friendship of the
                        Aetolians with whom the Lacedaemonians were in alliance. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Those who were sent to discuss the terms of the ransom
                        thought that the most central place for the conference, and the one most
                        convenient to both sides, was a spot near the tower called Galeagra, at the
                        Trogilian port. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As they went to and fro
                        there several times, one of the Romans took a near view of the wall, counted
                        the stones and formed an estimate in his mind of the thickness of each
                        stone. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> Having thus calculated the height
                        of the wall as well as he could by conjecture, and finding it lower than he
                        or any one else had supposed and capable of being scaled by a ladder of even
                        moderate length, he made a report to the consul. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> Marcellus attached considerable importance to his
                        suggestion, but as that part of the wall, being lower, was for that very
                        reason more carefully guarded, it was impossible to approach it and they had
                        to watch their opportunity, which soon came. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> A deserter brought word that the townspeople were
                        keeping the festival of Diana which lasted three days, and that, through
                        lack of other things, owing to the siege, they were celebrating the feast
                        mostly with wine, which Epicydes had distributed amongst the populace, and
                        the leading citizens amongst the tribes. On hearing this, Marcellus talked
                        the matter over with a few of the military tribunes, and through them
                        selected the centurions and private soldiers who were fittest for such a
                        daring enterprise. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Scaling ladders were
                        quietly got ready, and then all the rest of the men were ordered to seek
                        refreshment and rest as soon as they could, as a nocturnal expedition was in
                        front of them. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> As soon as he thought the
                        time had come when, after feasting all day, the men would have their fill of
                        wine and be in their first sleep, the consul ordered one maniple to carry
                        scaling ladders, and about a thousand men were silently marched in a narrow
                        column up to the spot. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> They got up on to
                        the wall without any confusion or noise and others at once followed in
                        order; even those who felt nervous were reassured by the daring of those in
                        front. </p>

                        possession of that section of the wall. They went on as far as the Hexapylon
                        without meeting a soul, as the majority of those on guard in the bastions
                        were either stupid with wine after their revels or were drinking themselves
                        drunk. They killed a few, however, whom they surprised in their beds.

                        postern gate near the Hexapylon was giving way to the violence of the blows,
                        and the agreed signal was given from the wall. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> They no longer attempted to conceal their movements,
                        but commenced an open attack, as they had now reached Epipolae, where there
                        was a large force on guard, and their object was now to frighten rather than
                        elude the enemy. They succeeded perfectly. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        For no sooner were the notes of the trumpets heard and the shouts of those
                        who held the wall and a part of the city, than the men on guard thought that
                        every part was taken, and some fled along the wall, others leaped from it,
                        and a crowd of panic-struck citizens took to headlong flight. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> A great many, however, were ignorant of the great
                        disaster that had befallen them, for everybody was heavy with, wine and
                        sleep, and in a city of such vast extent what was happening in one part was
                        not known to the population generally. </p>
                    <p>
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At daybreak Marcellus forced the gates of
                        the Hexapylon and entered the city with his entire force, rousing the
                        citizens who all betook themselves to arms, prepared to render what help
                        they could to a city which was all but captured. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> Epicydes made a hurried march from the Island-its local
                        name is Nasos-under the impression that a few men had succeeded in scaling
                        the walls owing to the negligence of the guards and that he would soon drive
                        them out. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> He told the terrified fugitives
                        whom he met that they were adding to the confusion and making things out to
                        be more serious and alarming than they really were. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> When, however, he saw every place round Epipolae full
                        of armed men, he simply discharged a few missiles at the enemy and marched
                        back to the Achradina, not so much through fear of the strength and numbers
                        of the enemy as of some opening for treason from within, which might close
                        the gates of Achradina and the Island against him in the confusion.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> When Marcellus mounted the
                        fortifications and saw from his higher ground the city below him, the

                        achievement, partly at the memory of its ancient glories. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> He thought of the Athenian fleets which had been sunk
                        in that harbour, of the two great armies with their famous generals which
                        had been annihilated there, of all of its many powerful kings and tyrants,
                        above all, of Hiero, whose memory was so fresh, and who, in addition to all
                        his endowments of fortune and character, had distinguished himself by his
                        services to Rome. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> As all this passed
                        through his mind and with it the thought that in one short hour all he saw
                        round him would be burnt and reduced to ashes, he <milestone n="15??"
                            unit="section"/> decided, before advancing against Achradina, to send
                        the Syracusans, who, as already stated, were with the Roman troops, into the
                        city to try if kind words could induce the enemy to surrender the place.

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The gates and walls of Achradina were
                        mostly held by the deserters who were hopeless of obtaining mercy on any
                        terms, and they allowed no one to approach the walls or to speak to them.
                            <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> So Marcellus, finding that his project
                        had failed, ordered the troops to return to Euryalus. This was a hill in the
                        furthest part of the city, away from the sea, and overlooking the road which
                        leads into the country and the inland part of the island. It was, therefore,
                        admirably adapted for the reception of supplies from the interior.
                            <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The command of the citadel here had
                        been entrusted by Epicydes to Philodemus an Argive. Sosis, one of the
                        regicides, had been sent by Marcellus to open up negotiations, but after a
                        long conversation in which he found himself put off with evasive replies he
                        reported to Marcellus that Philodemus was taking time for consideration.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He continued to procrastinate from day
                        to day, to allow time for Hippocrates and Himilco to bring up their legions,
                        feeling quite sure that if he had them in his stronghold the Romans would be
                        shut up within the walls and annihilated. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        As Marcellus saw that Euryalus could not be taken by either treachery or
                        force, he established his camp between Neapolis and Tycha-parts of the city,
                        and almost cities in themselves-as he was afraid if he entered the more
                        populous parts he would not be able to keep his soldiers from dispersing in
                        their eagerness for plunder. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Envoys came
                        to him from these two places with olive branches and woollen fillets,
                        imploring him that they might be spared from fire and sword. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> Marcellus held a council of war to consider this
                        request, or rather this entreaty, and in accordance with the wish of all
                        present he gave notice to the soldiers that they were not to lay hands on
                        any free citizen; everything else they were at liberty to appropriate.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Instead of fosse and rampart the camp
                        was protected by the private houses which served it for walls, and sentinels
                        and pickets were posted at the gates of the houses which stood open to the
                        street to secure the camp against attack while the soldiers were dispersed
                        in the city. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> After this the signal was
                        given and the soldiers ran in all directions, breaking open the house doors
                        and filling everything with uproar and panic, but they refrained from
                        bloodshed. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> There was no limit to the work
                        of rapine until they had cleared the houses of all the goods and possessions
                        which had been accumulating during the long spell of prosperity. <milestone
                            n="11" unit="section"/> Whilst this was going on, Philodemus saw that
                        there was no hope of succour, and after getting the promise of a safe
                        conduct for him to return to Epicydes, he withdrew his garrison and handed
                        the position over to the Romans. Whilst everybody was preoccupied with the
                        tumult in the captured part of the city, Bomilcar seized the opportunity to
                        escape. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The night was a tempestuous one,
                        and the Roman fleet were unable to keep their anchorage off the harbour, so
                        he slipped out with thirty-five ships, and finding the sea clear set sail
                        for Carthage, leaving fifty-five ships for Epicydes and the Syracusans.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> After making the Carthaginians
                        realise the critical state of affairs at Syracuse he returned with a hundred
                        ships a few days later and was rewarded-so they say-by Epicydes with gifts
                        from Hiero's treasury. </p>

                        by a Roman garrison relieved Marcellus of one cause of anxiety; he had no
                        longer to dread an attack from the rear which might have created confusion
                        amongst his men, shut in and hampered as they were by walls. <milestone

                        some days the outposts were undisturbed, when the sudden arrival of
                        Hippocrates and Himilco led to a general attack upon the Roman lines.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Hippocrates had formed an entrenched
                        camp at the Great Harbour, and after giving a signal to the troops in
                        Achradina he made an attack on the old camp of the Romans which Crispinus
                        commanded. Epicydes made a sortie against Marcellus and the Carthaginian
                        fleet which lay between the city and the Roman camp was brought ashore and
                        so prevented Crispinus from sending any help to Marcellus. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> The excitement which the enemy caused was, however,
                        much more alarming than the fighting, for Crispinus not only drove
                        Hippocrates back from his entrenchments, but actually went in pursuit as he
                        fled hurriedly away, whilst Marcellus drove Epicydes back into the city.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> And now, apparently, ample provision
                        was made against danger arising from any sudden attacks in the future. </p>
                    <p> To add to their troubles both sides were visited by pestilence, a calamity

                            unit="section"/> It was the time of autumn and the locality was
                        naturally unhealthy, more so, however, outside the city than within it, and
                        the insupportable heat affected the constitutions of almost all who were in
                        the two camps. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In the beginning people
                        fell ill and died through the effects of the season and the unhealthy
                        locality; later, the nursing of the sick and contact with them spread the
                        disease, so that either those who had caught it died neglected and
                        abandoned, or else they carried off with them those who were waiting on them
                        and nursing them, and who had thus become infected. Deaths and funerals were
                        a daily spectacle; on all sides, day and night, were heard the wailings for
                        the dead. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At last familiarity with misery

                        awaiting a similar death. So what with fear and the foul and deadly miasma
                        arising from the bodies, the dead proved fatal to the sick and the sick
                        equally fatal to those in health. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Men
                        preferred to die by the sword; some, single-handed, attacked the enemies'

                        prevalent in the Carthaginian camp than in that of the Romans, for their
                        long investment of Syracuse had made them more accustomed to the climate and
                        to the water. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> The Sicilians who were in
                        the hostile ranks deserted as soon as they saw that the disease was
                        spreading through the unhealthiness of the place, and went off to their own
                        cities. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The Carthaginians, who had
                        nowhere to go to, perished to a man together with their generals,
                        Hippocrates and Himilco. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> When the disease
                        assumed such serious proportions Marcellus transferred his men to the city,
                        and those who had been weakened by sickness were restored by shade and
                        shelter. Still, many of the Roman soldiers, too, were carried off by that
                        pestilence. </p>

                        had been thus wiped out, the Sicilians who had been with Hippocrates took
                        possession of two walled towns, not large ones certainly, but made safe by
                        their situation and strong fortifications. One was three miles from
                        Syracuse, the other fifteen. They carried supplies to these towns from their
                        own states and asked for reinforcements. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                        Bomilcar had in the meantime paid a second visit to Carthage with his fleet
                        and had drawn such a picture of the state of things in Syracuse as to lead
                        the government to hope that they might not only render effectual assistance
                        to their friends, but even succeed in capturing the Romans inside that city,
                        which they had in some measure captured. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        He persuaded them to despatch as many cargo ships as they could, laden with
                        stores of all kinds, and also to augment his force of fighting ships. The
                        result was that he left Carthage with 130 ships of war and 700 transports.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The winds were favourable for him
                        whilst sailing for Sicily, but they prevented him from rounding the
                        promontory of Pachinus. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The news of
                        Bomilcar's approach and then his unexpected delay excited first hope and
                        then fear amongst the Syracusans and just the reverse among the Romans.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Epicydes was afraid that if the east
                        wind lasted much longer the Carthaginian fleet would return to Africa, and
                        he handed <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> Achradina over to the
                        commanders of the mercenaries and put off to meet Bomilcar. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> He found him at anchor with his ships headed for the
                        African coast and anxious to avoid a naval engagement, not because he was
                        inferior in the strength or number of his ships-he really had more than the
                        Romans-but because the winds were more favourable to them than to him;
                        Epicydes, however, persuaded him to try his chance in a sea fight.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When Marcellus became aware that an
                        army of Sicilians was being raised from the whole of the island, and that a
                        Carthaginian fleet was approaching with vast supplies, he determined, though
                        inferior in the number of ships to prevent Bomilcar from reaching Syracuse,
                        lest he should be shut in by sea and land whilst he was confined and
                        hampered in a hostile city. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The two
                        fleets lay facing each other off the promontory of Pachinus, ready to engage
                        as soon as the sea was calm enough to allow them to sail into deep water.
                            <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> As soon as the east wind, which had
                        been blowing strongly for some days, dropped Bomilcar made the first move.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> It seemed as though he was making for
                        the open sea in order the better to round the promontory, but when he saw
                        the Roman ships sailing straight for him he crowded on all sail and skirting
                        the coast of Sicily made for Tarentum, having previously sent a message to
                        Heraclea ordering the transports to return to Africa. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> Finding all his hopes suddenly crushed, Epicydes did

                        of which was already taken. He sailed for Agrigentum, to watch events rather
                        than to control them. </p>

                        the camp of the Sicilians, viz. that Epicydes had left Syracuse and that the
                        island had been abandoned by the Carthaginians and almost surrendered a
                        second <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> time to the Romans, they sent
                        envoys to Marcellus to treat for the surrender of the city, having
                        previously sounded in frequent interviews the feelings of those who were
                        undergoing the siege. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They were
                        practically united on these two points, that all that had been included in
                        the king's dominions should belong to Rome, and that all else was to be
                        retained by the Sicilians together with their liberty and their laws.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They then invited those who had been
                        left in charge by Epicydes to a conference, the envoys telling them that the
                        army of the Sicilians had sent them to them as well as to Marcellus, so that
                        those who were within and those who were outside of the beleaguered city
                        might share the same fortune, and neither should make separate terms for
                        themselves. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Admission was granted to them
                        that they might converse with their friends and relatives. After explaining
                        the nature of their understanding with Marcellus and holding out a prospect
                        of safety, they persuaded them to join in an attack upon those to whom
                        Epicydes had committed the government-Polyclitus, Philistio, and Epicydes,
                        surnamed Sindon. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They were put to death
                        and the citizens were summoned to a public meeting. Here the envoys
                        complained bitterly of the straits they were in for food, and the other
                        evils which they had been in the habit of grumbling about in secret; they
                        said that although they had so much to distress them, they must not throw
                        the blame on Fortune; it was in their own power to decide how long they
                        would endure it. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The motives which led the
                        Romans to attack Syracuse were those of affection, not animosity. When they
                        heard that the reins of government had been seized by Hippocrates and
                        Epicydes, who had been first creatures of Hannibal and then of Hieronymus,
                        they set their armies in motion and began the siege, not for the purpose of
                        destroying the city but of crushing those who were tyrannising over it.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But now that Hippocrates was disposed
                        of and Epicydes shut out from Syracuse and his officers put to death, what
                        was there left to prevent the Romans from wishing that Syracuse should be
                        free from all harm, just as they would have wished it had Hiero, that
                        eminently loyal friend of Rome, been still alive? <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> There was, then, no danger either to the city or its
                        people other than what would arise from their own action if they let slip
                        that chance of reconciliation with Rome. There would never be another so
                        favourable as the one they had at that moment, just when it was plain to all
                        that Syracuse had been delivered from an impotent tyranny. </p>

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> This address was received with universal
                        approval. It was, however, decided to elect magistrates before sending the
                        envoys. From amongst the magistrates so elected they selected the envoys who
                        were to be sent to Marcellus. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Their leader
                        addressed him in the following terms: "It is not we, the people of Syracuse,
                        who have revolted from you, but Hieronymus, who acted much more wickedly
                        towards us than towards you. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And when
                        peace had been restored by the tyrant's death it was no Syracusan, but the
                        king's creatures Hippocrates and Epicydes, who disturbed it, by crushing us
                        on the one hand by fear, on the other by treachery. No man can say that
                        there was ever a time during which we enjoyed liberty when we were not at
                        peace with you. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Now, at all events, no
                        sooner have we become our own masters through the death of the oppressors of
                        Syracuse than we come to you to give up our arms, to surrender ourselves,
                        our city and its fortifications, to accept any condition which you may lay
                        upon us. To you, Marcellus, the gods have vouchsafed the glory of capturing
                        the noblest and fairest of Grecian cities. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        Whatever memorable achievement we have wrought by sea or land enhances the
                        splendour of your triumph. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Would you wish
                        that it should be only a glorious tradition how great a city you have
                        captured, rather than that it should be a spectacle for the eyes of
                        posterity to rest upon? That it should exhibit to all who visit it by land
                        or sea the trophies we have won from Athenians and Carthaginians, which are
                        now the trophies you have won from us? That you should hand down to your
                        house an unharmed Syracuse to be kept under the patronage and protection of
                        all who bear the name of Marcellus? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Let
                        not the memory of Hieronymus weigh more with you than that of Hiero. He was
                        your friend for a far longer time than the other was your enemy. You found
                        in him a real benefactor; this man's madness only availed to his own
                        destruction." As far as the Romans were concerned they could have gained all
                        they wanted in perfect security. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> It was
                        amongst the besieged themselves that war existed with all its perils. The
                        deserters, thinking that they were being betrayed, communicated their fears
                        to the mercenaries; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> they all flew to arms,
                        and beginning with the murder of the magistrates they commenced a general
                        massacre of the citizens, killing in their desperate madness everybody they

                            unit="section"/> Then, that they might not be without officers, they
                        elected six, three to command in Achradina and three in Nasos. When the
                        tumult had somewhat subsided and the mercenaries found out on inquiry what
                        agreement had been come to with the Romans, the truth began to dawn upon
                        them, and they realised that their case was quite distinct from that of the

                        <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The envoys came back from their interview
                        with Marcellus just at the right moment, and were able to assure them that
                        their suspicions were groundless and that the Romans saw no reason why they
                        should visit them with punishment. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> One of
                        the three commanders in Achradina was a Spaniard named Moericus, and amongst
                        those who accompanied the envoys a soldier from the Spanish auxiliaries had
                        designedly been introduced. When they had entered Achradina this man
                        obtained a private interview with Moericus and described to him the state of
                        affairs in Spain, which he had quite recently left, and how everything there
                        was under the power of Rome. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> If Moericus
                        chose to make himself of use to the Romans, he might be a leading man among
                        his countrymen, and either take service under the Roman standard or return
                        to his own country, whichever he chose. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        But if on the other hand he preferred to remain under siege, what hope had
                        he of relief, shut in as he was by sea and land? Moericus was impressed by
                        the force of these arguments, and after it had been decided to send envoys
                        to Marcellus, he sent his brother as one of them. The same Spanish soldier
                        conducted him by himself to Marcellus. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> In
                        this interview the details were settled and Marcellus pledged himself to
                        observe the conditions, after which the envoys returned to Achradina. In
                        order to avoid the least chance of suspicion Moericus made it known that he
                        disapproved of envoys going to and fro, and gave orders that none were to be
                        admitted and none sent. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Also, with a view
                        to greater security, he thought that the conduct of the defence ought to be
                        properly distributed amongst the three commanders, so that each might be
                        responsible for his own section of the fortifications. They all agreed.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> In the division, his command extended
                        from the fountain of Arethusa to the mouth of the Great Harbour, and he
                        managed to let the Romans know that. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> So
                        Marcellus ordered a cargo ship filled with troops to be towed by a
                        quadrireme to the Island, and the men to land near the gate adjoining the
                        fountain. This order was carried out in the fourth watch, and Moericus, as
                        previously arranged, admitted the soldiers through the gate. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> At dawn Marcellus attacked Achradina with his
                        full strength, and not only those who were actually holding it, but the
                        troops in Nasos also, left their posts and ran to defend Achradina from the
                        assault of the Romans. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> In the confusion
                        of the attack some swift vessels, which had previously been brought round to
                        Nasos, landed troops. These making an unexpected attack upon the half-manned
                        posts, and rushing through the gates, still open, out of which the garrison
                        had just sallied to defend Achradina, had little trouble in capturing a
                        position which had been abandoned owing to the flight of its defenders.

                        at once sent a deputation to Marcellus with the one request that they and

                        called a council of war, to which he summoned the Syracusan refugees in the

                        who have held Syracuse quite outweigh all the good services which Hiero

                        Most of these, it is true, have recoiled on the heads of those who were
                        guilty of them, and they have punished themselves for their breach of
                        treaties far more severely than the Roman people could have wished.

                        bondage. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> What the Syracusans could have
                        done has been shown by those amongst them who have been living within the

                        happened in Spain; the contest was carried on by diplomacy more than by
                        arms. This summer the Roman commanders on leaving their winter quarters
                        united their forces. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> A council of war was
                        called and they came to a unanimous decision that as up to that time all
                        they had done was to keep Hasdrubal from marching to Italy, it was now high
                        time to make an effort to finish the war. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                        During the winter they had raised a force of 20,000 Celtiberians, and with
                        this reinforcement they considered themselves strong enough for the task.
                        The enemies' force consisted of three armies. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> Hasdrubal, the son of Gisgo, had united his army with
                        Mago, and their joint camp was about a five days' march from the Romans.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Somewhat nearer to them was Hasdrubal,
                        the son of Hamilcar, an old commander in Spain, who was in camp at a city
                        called Amtorgis. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The Roman commanders
                        wanted to dispose of him first, and they believed that they had more than
                        enough strength for the purpose; the only doubt in their minds was whether,
                        after his defeat, the other Hasdrubal and Mago would not retreat into the
                        trackless forest and mountains and keep up a guerilla warfare. <milestone
                            n="7" unit="section"/> The best plan, they thought, would be to form
                        their force into two armies and finish the war in Spain at one stroke. They
                        arranged accordingly that P. Cornelius was to advance against Mago and
                        Hasdrubal with two-thirds of the army of Romans and allied <milestone

                        Romans formed only a small portion of the army and that they were depending
                        entirely upon their Celtiberian auxiliaries, he determined to detach the
                        latter from their Roman service. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> He was
                        quite at home with every form of treachery known to barbarians, and
                        especially those practised by the tribes amongst whom he had for so many
                        years been campaigning. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Both camps were
                        full of Spaniards, who had no difficulty in understanding each other's
                        language, and secret interviews were held, in the course of which he made an
                        agreement with the Celtiberian chieftains, by the offer of a large bribe,
                        that they should withdraw their forces. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        They did not look upon this as very atrocious conduct, for it was not a
                        question of turning their arms against the Romans, and though the money was
                        quite equal to the pay they received in war, it was given them to abstain
                        from war. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Then, too, the mere rest from
                        the toils of the campaign, the thought of returning home, the delight of
                        seeing their friends and their possessions were universally welcomed. So the
                        mass of the troops were quite as easily persuaded as their chiefs, and they
                        had nothing to fear from the Romans who were too few in number to keep them
                        lack by force. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This is a thing against
                        which Roman generals will always have to be on their guard, and instances
                        such as these ought to serve as warnings that they must not depend upon
                        foreign auxiliaries to such an extent as not to have in their camp a
                        preponderance of that solidity and fighting power which native troops can
                        alone supply. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Celtiberians took up
                        their standards and marched off. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The
                        Romans asked them why they were going, and appealed to them to stay where
                        they were, but the only answer they got was that they were called away by a
                        war at home. When Scipio saw that his allies could not be detained by either
                        appeals or force and that without them he was no match for the enemy, whilst
                        a junction with his brother was out of the question, he determined to
                        retreat as far as he could; this seemed the only safe measure to adopt.
                            <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> His one object was to avoid an

                        of Numidian horse, and he kept up incessant attacks upon him day and night.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> He not only cut off all who had
                        wandered too far from camp in search of wood and fodder, but he actually
                        rode up to the camp and charged into the middle of the outposts and pickets,
                        creating alarm and confusion everywhere. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        In the night he frequently upset the camp by making a sudden rush at the
                        gates and the stockade; there was no place and no time at which the Romans
                        were free from anxiety and fear, and they were compelled to keep within
                        their lines, unable to obtain anything they wanted. <milestone n="6"
                            unit="section"/> It was fast becoming a regular siege and would
                        evidently become a still closer one if Indebilis, who was reported to be
                        approaching with 7500 Suessetanians, should join the Carthaginians.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Cautious and prudent general though he
                        was, Scipio was compelled by his position to take the hazardous step of
                        making a night march to oppose Indebilis' advance and to fight him wherever
                        he met him. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Leaving a small force to guard
                        the camp and placing Tiberius Fonteius in command, he started at midnight
                        and encountered the enemy. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They fought in
                        order of march rather than of battle; the Romans, however, had the
                        advantage, in spite of its being an irregular battle. But the Numidian
                        horse, whom Scipio thought he had eluded, swept round both flanks and
                        created the greatest alarm. A fresh action had now begun against the
                        Numidians when a third enemy appeared; the Carthaginian generals had come up
                        and were attacking the rear. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The Romans
                        had to face a battle on both flanks and on their rear, and could not make up
                        their minds against what enemy to make their main attack or in what
                        direction to close their line and charge. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        Whilst their commander was fighting and encouraging his men and exposing
                        himself in the hottest of the turmoil he was run through by a lance in his
                        left side. The massed body of the enemy who had charged the closed ranks

                        horse were wild with joy and ran in all directions shouting that the Roman
                        commander had fallen. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The news spread
                        over the whole field, and the enemy at once regarded themselves as
                        unquestionably victorious, while the Romans equally felt themselves
                        vanquished. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> With the loss of the general
                        there began at once a flight from the field. It was not difficult to break
                        through the Numidians and other light-armed troops, but it was almost
                        impossible to make one's escape amidst such numbers of cavalry and of foot
                        soldiers who rivalled horses in speed. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                        Almost more were killed in flight than in battle, and not a man would have

                        general, who saw himself deserted by his allies and knew that the forces of
                        the enemy were so largely augmented, was led still further by his own
                        conjectures and inferences to suspect the occurrence of some disaster much
                        sooner than to entertain any hopes of success. <milestone n="5"
                            unit="section"/> "How," he asked himself, "could Hasdrubal and Mago have
                        brought up their army without opposition if they had not brought their own
                        share of the war to a successful close? <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        How could his brother have failed to stop them or to follow them up so that
                        if he could not prevent their forming a junction he could at least have
                        united his own forces with those of his brother?" <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> Filled with these anxieties he believed that the only
                        safe course for him for the time being was to retreat from his present
                        position as far as he could. He accordingly accomplished a considerable
                        march in a single night, unobserved by the enemy and therefore unmolested.
                            <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> When it grew light the enemy became
                        aware of his departure, and sending on the Numidians in advance, commenced
                        the pursuit with the utmost speed of which they were capable. The Numidians
                        came up with them before nightfall, and by making repeated charges on flank
                        and rear compelled them to come to a halt and defend themselves. <milestone
                            n="9" unit="section"/> Scipio, however, urged them to fight as well as
                        they could and keep moving forward before they were overtaken by the
                        infantry. </p>

                        halting, they had for some time been making very little progress and night
                        was close at hand, Scipio called his men <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/>
                        off from battle, massed them in close order, and led them to some rising
                        ground, not, indeed, a very safe position, especially for unnerved troops,
                        but still somewhat more elevated than the ground round it. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> The baggage and the cavalry were placed in the centre
                        and the infantry drawn up round them, and at first they had no difficulty in
                        repelling the attacks of the Numidians. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                        But when the three commanders appeared in full force with three regular
                        armies it was obvious that they would be unable to defend the position by
                        arms alone in the absence of entrenchments. The general began to look round
                        him and consider whether it were in any way possible to surround himself
                        with an earthwork. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But the hill was so
                        bare and the ground so rocky that there was no brushwood to cut for a
                        stockade nor earth for constructing a rampart or carrying a fosse or for any
                        other work. No part was naturally so steep or precipitous as to render the
                        approach or ascent difficult for the enemy; the whole surface of the hill
                        rose in a gentle slope. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In order, however,
                        to present to the enemy something which might look like <milestone n="7??"

                        packs which the animals carried and piled them up all round them as if they
                        were building up a rampart to the usual height, and where there were not
                        enough saddles they made it up by throwing all the kits and packages of
                        every kind into the gaps, as a barricade. </p>

                        their column had no difficulty in mounting the hill, but they stopped short
                        at the sight of the novel defence as though it were something uncanny. Their
                        officers shouted out on all sides: "Why are you stopping? Why do you not
                        tear down and demolish that juggler's trick, which is hardly strong enough
                        to stop women and children? <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The enemy,

                        officers, it was anything but easy either to clamber over or to push away
                        the heavy obstacles in front of them, or to cut through the tightly packed
                        saddles, buried as they were beneath the baggage. <milestone n="11"

                        away the heavy obstacles and opened a way for the troops, and when they had
                        done this in several places the camp was rushed on all sides and captured;
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> the little band of defenders were
                        slaughtered by the masses of the enemy, helpless in the hands of their

                        escaped to P. Scipio's camp where Ti. Fonteius was in command. <milestone
                            n="13" unit="section"/> Some traditions assert that Cn. Scipio was
                        killed in the first onset of the enemy on the hill; according to others he
                        escaped to a tower near the camp, and as they were unable to break down the
                        door with all their efforts, they lighted fires against it, and after it was
                        burnt away they slew all inside including the commander. <milestone n="14"
                            unit="section"/> Cn. Scipio was killed after he had been eight years in
                        Spain, and twenty-nine days after his brother's death. The grief felt at
                        their death was as great throughout Spain as it was in Rome. <milestone
                            n="15" unit="section"/> The City had to mourn not only for them, but for
                        the loss of its armies, the defection of the province, and the blow
                        inflicted on the republic; in Spain it was the generals themselves whose
                        loss was so bitterly felt, more so in the case of Cnaeus, because he had
                        held his command there for a longer time; <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                        he too was the first to win popularity amongst the people, the first to show

                        seemed as though Spain must be lost. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> But
                        one man restored the fallen fortunes of the State. There was in the army a
                        Lucius Marcius, the son of Septimius, a Roman knight, an active and
                        energetic youth whose character and abilities were somewhat superior to the
                        position in which he had been born. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> His
                        many natural gifts had been developed by Scipio's training, under whom he
                        had learnt all the arts of war. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Out of the
                        fugitive soldiers whom he had rallied, and some whom he had drawn from the
                        garrisons in Spain, he had formed quite a respectable army, and with it had
                        joined Ti. Fonteius, Scipio's lieutenant. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        After they had entrenched themselves in a camp on this side of the Ebrot his
                        soldiers decided to hold a regular election for the purpose of choosing a
                        general to command the united armies, and they relieved each other on
                        sentinel and outpost duty so that every man might give his vote. <milestone
                            n="6" unit="section"/> So far did the Roman knight surpass all others in
                        the authority and respect which he possessed with the soldiers that the
                        whole army unanimously conferred the supreme command on L. Marcius.
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> After this he spent the whole of the
                        time-and short enough it was-in strengthening the defences of the camp and
                        storing supplies in it, and the soldiers carried out all his commands with
                        alacrity and in anything but a despondent mood. <milestone n="8"
                            unit="section"/> But when the news arrived that Hasdrubal-Gisgo's
                        son-had crossed the Ebro and was coming to stamp out the remains of the war
                        and the soldiers saw the signal for battle put out by their new general they
                        gave way completely. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The recollection of
                        the men who had so lately commanded them, the proud confidence which they
                        had always felt in their generals and their armies when they went into
                        battle quite unnerved them; they all burst into tears and smote their heads;
                        some raised their hands to heaven and reproached the gods; others lay on the
                        ground and invoked the names of their old commanders. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> Nothing could check these wild outbursts of grief,
                        though the centurions tried to rouse their men, and Marcius himself went
                        about calming them and at the same time reproaching them for their unmanly
                        conduct. "Why," he asked them, "have you given way to womanish and idle
                        tears instead of bracing yourselves up to defend yourselves and the republic
                        and not allowing your commanders' death to go unavenged?" </p>

                        of trumpets, for the enemy was now close up to the rampart. In an instant
                        their grief changed to fury, they rushed to arms, and racing to the gates
                        like madmen they dashed upon the enemy who were coming on carelessly and in
                        disorder. The sudden and unlooked for movement created a panic among the
                        Carthaginians. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> They wondered whence all
                        these enemies had arisen, after their army had been all but annihilated,
                        what gave such daring and self-confidence to men who had been vanquished and
                        put to flight, who had come forward as their commander now that the two
                        Scipios were killed, who was over the camp, who had given the signal for
                        battle. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Bewildered and astounded at all
                        these utterly unlooked-for surprises they at first slowly retired, then as
                        the attack became heavier and more insistent they turned and fled.
                            <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> There would have been either a
                        frightful slaughter amongst the fugitives or a rash and dangerous attack on
                        the part of the pursuers if Marcius had not hurriedly given the signal to
                        retire and kept back the excited troops by throwing himself in front of the
                        foremost and even holding some back with his hands. Then he marched them
                        back to camp still thirsting for blood. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                        When the Carthaginians saw that none were pursuing them after the first
                        repulse from the rampart they imagined that they had been afraid to go any
                        further, their feelings of contempt returned, and they marched at a
                        leisurely pace back to their camp. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> They
                        showed as much carelessness in guarding their own camp as they had shown in
                        attacking the Roman, for although their enemy was near them they regarded
                        them as only the wreckage of two armies which had been destroyed a few days
                        before. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> Whilst they were, in consequence
                        of this, neglectful of everything, Marcius, who had become thoroughly aware
                        of it, thought out a plan, at first glance hazardous rather than bold, which
                        was to assume the aggressive and attack the enemy's camp. <milestone n="18"
                            unit="section"/> He thought it would be easier to storm Hasdrubal's camp
                        whilst he was alone than to defend his own, in case the three commanders
                        united their forces once more. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/> Besides,
                        if he succeeded he would have gone far to retrieve their late disasters; if
                        he failed the enemy could no longer despise him, since he would have been
                        the first to attack. </p>

                        daring at the bidding of your commander. When I gave the signal yesterday to
                        recall you from your hot pursuit of your disordered foe it was from no wish
                        to damp your courage but to reserve it for a greater and more glorious
                        occasion, when you will shortly <milestone n="12??" unit="section"/> be
                        able, prepared and armed, to fall upon the enemy when he is off his guard,
                        without his arms and even wrapped in slumbers. And in thus hoping, I am not
                        trusting simply to chance, but have good grounds for what I say. <milestone

                        you managed to defend your camp against a mighty host, how after your defeat
                        you were able to repel those who had defeated you from your rampart, you
                        would, I am sure, reply that this was the very danger you feared, and
                        therefore you strengthened your defences in every possible way and held

                        And such is generally the case; men are least safe when their circumstances

                        enemy are less afraid of than that we who were lately surrounded and
                        attacked should of our own motion attack their camp. Let us venture where no
                        one can believe we will venture. The fact that it is thought too difficult
                        will make it all the easier. I will lead you out in a silent march at the

                        was in its full strength? <milestone n="21" unit="section"/> As our generals
                        perished owing to their forces being divided, so the enemy can be crushed in
                        detail while they are divided. There is no other way of carrying on war; let
                        us, then, wait for nothing beyond the opportunity of the coming night.

                        pleased them. The rest of the day was spent in getting their arms ready and
                        in looking after themselves. At the fourth watch they began to move. </p>

                        cohort, adopting Punic tactics, concealed themselves with some cavalry.

                        mounted they penetrated without any opposition into the camp just as if they
                        were entering their own. Then the signals were sounded and the battle shout
                        raised. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Some slew the enemy while half

                        either hearing one another on taking any measures for their safety.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Without arms themselves they fell
                        amongst troops of armed men; some rushed to the gates, others, finding the

                        at once to <milestone n="6??" unit="section"/> the other camp, where they
                        were met by the cohort and the cavalry running out from their concealment
                        and all cut down to a man. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Even if any one
                        had escaped from the carnage the Romans, after taking that camp, ran on so
                        swiftly to the other one that no one could get there before them to announce
                        the disaster. </p>

                        found neglect and disorder everywhere, partly owing to its greater distance
                        from them and partly because some of the defenders had dispersed in quest of
                        fodder and wood and plunder. At the outposts the arms were actually piled,
                        the soldiers, all unarmed, were sitting and lying about on the ground or
                        walking up and down in front of the gates and rampart. <milestone n="9"
                            unit="section"/> In this state of careless disorder they were assailed
                        by the Romans who were tired by their recent fighting and flushed with
                        victory. It was impossible to hold the gates against them, and once within
                        the gates a desperate battle began. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> At
                        the first alarm there was a rush from all parts of the camp, and there would
                        have been a long and obstinate struggle if the Carthaginians had not seen in
                        the blood-stained shields of the Romans plain traces of the former contest,
                        which filled them with dismay and terror. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                        They all turned and fled wherever they could find the way open to escape,
                        and all but those who had been already killed were driven out of the camp.
                            <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> So in a night and a day two of the

                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> According to Claudius, who translated
                        the annals of Acilius from Greek into Latin, as many as 37,000 of the enemy
                        were slain, 1830 being prisoners, besides an immense amount of plunder. The
                        latter included a silver shield one hundred and thirty-seven pounds in

                        taken, when the enemy lost 7000 killed; in the other battle when the Romans
                        made the sortie and fought with Hasdrubal 10,000 were killed and 4380 made
                        prisoners. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Piso says that 5000 men were
                        killed when Mago was ambushed while recklessly pursuing our men. <milestone

                        Marcius, and they exaggerate the glory he really won by describing a
                        supernatural incident. Whilst he was addressing his troops they say that a
                        flame shot from his head, without his being aware of it, to the great terror
                        of the soldiers standing round. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> It is
                        also stated that there was in the temple on the Capitol before it was burnt

                        his victory. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> For some time after this,
                        matters were quiet in Spain, neither side after the defeats they had

                            unit="section"/> He removed to Rome the ornaments of the city, the
                        statues and pictures in which Syracuse abounded; they were, it is true,
                        spoils taken from the enemy and acquired by the laws of war, but that was
                        the beginning of our admiration for Greek works of art, which has led to the
                        present reckless spoliation of every kind of treasure, sacred and profane
                        alike. This has at last recoiled upon the gods of Rome, upon that temple
                        especially which Marcellus so splendidly adorned. <milestone n="3"
                            unit="section"/> For the shrines near the Capena Gate, which Marcellus
                        dedicated, used to be visited by strangers on account of the very beautiful
                        specimens of that class of ornament; but very few are to be seen today.
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Whilst Marcellus was settling the
                        affairs of Sicily, deputations from nearly all the communities in the island
                        visited him. The treatment they received varied with their circumstances.
                        Those who had not revolted or had returned to our friendship prior to the
                        capture of Syracuse were welcomed and honoured as loyal allies; those who
                        after its capture had surrendered through fear, had to accept the terms
                        which the victor imposes on the vanquished. The Romans, however, had
                        considerable remnants of the war still on their hands round Agrigentum.
                            <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There were still left in the field the
                        generals Epicydes and Hanno who had commanded in the late war, and a fresh
                        general who had been sent in place of Hippocrates by Hannibal, a man of
                        Libyphoeniclan nationality, called Hippacritanus-his fellow-countrymen
                        called him Muttines-a man of energy and enterprise, who had had a thorough

                        Numidians, and with these troopers he committed such extensive depredations
                        on the lands of those who were hostile and was so active in keeping his

                        the advice of Muttines, they ventured outside and fixed their camp by the

                        broken out amongst the Numidians in Hanno's camp. Nearly three hundred of
                        them had gone off to Heraclea Minoa. When he left the camp to reason with
                        them and recall them, he is said to have most earnestly advised the generals
                        not to engage the enemy in his absence. They both resented this; more
                        especially Hanno who had long been jealous of Muttines' reputation.

                        they kept their promise on that occasion. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                        The news flew quickly through the ranks that the cavalry of whom they stood
                        in greatest fear had left the enemy in the lurch, and their courage rose
                        accordingly. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The enemy, on the other hand,
                        were in a great state of alarm because, not only were they losing the
                        support of their strongest arm, but there was a chance of their being
                        attacked by their own cavalry. So there was not much of a conflict, the
                        action was decided by the first battle shout and charge. <milestone n="7"
                            unit="section"/> When the opposing lines met, the Numidians were
                        standing quietly on the wings; when they saw their own side turn tail they
                        joined them in their flight for a short distance, but when they saw them
                        making in all haste for Agrigentum they dispersed to all the neighbouring
                        cities for fear of having to stand a siege. Several thousand men were killed
                        and eight elephants captured. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This was the
                        last battle Marcellus fought in Sicily. After his victory he returned to
                        Syracuse. As the year was now almost at an end, the senate decreed
                            <milestone n="9??" unit="section"/> that the praetor P. Cornelius should
                        send instructions to the consuls at Capua for one of them, if they approved,
                        to come to Rome to appoint new magistrates while Hannibal was at a distance
                        and no very critical operations were going on at Capua. <milestone n="10"
                            unit="section"/> After receiving the despatch the consuls came to a
                        mutual arrangement that Claudius should conduct the elections and Fulvius
                        remain at Capua. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The new consuls were Cn.
                        Fulvius Centimalus and P. Sulpicius Galba, the son of Servius, a man who had
                        never before filled a curule office. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The
                        election of praetors followed; those elected were L. Cornelius Lentulus, M.
                        Cornelius Cethegus, C. Sulpicius, and C. Calpurnius Piso. <milestone n="13"
                            unit="section"/> Piso took over the urban jurisdiction, Sicily was
                        allotted to Sulpicius, Apulia to Cethegus, Sardinia to Lentulus. The consuls
                        had their commands extended for another year. </p>
