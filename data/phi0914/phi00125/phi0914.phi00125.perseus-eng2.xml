                    <p> Publius Cornelius Scipio, afterwards called Africanus, elected aedile before
                        he had attained the age required by the law. The citadel of Tarentum, in
                        which the Roman garrison had taken refuge, betrayed to Hannibal. Games
                        instituted in honour of Apollo, called Apollinarian. Quintus Ful- vius and
                        Appius Claudius, consuls, defeat Hanno the Carthaginian ge- neral. Tiberius
                        Sempronius Gracchus betrayed by a Lucanian to Mago, and slain. Centenius
                        Penula, who had been a centurion, asks the senate for the command of an
                        army, promising to engage and vanquish Han- nibal; is cut off with eight
                        thousand men. Cneius Fulvius engages Han- nibal; and is beaten, with the
                        loss of sixteen thousand men slain; he himself escapes with only two hundred
                        horsemen. Quintus Fulvius and Appius Claudius, consuls, lay siege to Capua.
                        Syracuse taken by Clau- dius Marcellus after a siege of three years. In the
                        tumult occasioned by taking the city, Archimedes is killed while intently
                        occupied on some figures which he had drawn in the sand. Publius and
                        Cornelius Scipio, after having performed many eminent services in Spain, are
                        slain, toge- ther with nearly the whole of their armies, eight years after
                        their arrival in that country; and the possession of that province would
                        have been en- tirely lost, but for the valour and activity of Lucius
                        Marcius, a Roman knight, who, collecting the scattered remains of the
                        vanquished armies, utterly defeats the enemy; storming their two camps,
                        killing thirty-seven thousand of them, and taking eighteen hundred together
                        with an im- mense booty. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> HANNIBAL passed the summer during which these
                    events occurred in Africa and Italy, in the Tarentine territory, with the hope
                    of having the city of the Tarentines betrayed to him. Meanwhile some
                    inconsiderable towns belonging to them, and to the Sallentines, revolted to him.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> At the same time, of the twelve states of
                    the Bruttians, which had in a former year gone over to the Carthaginians, the
                    Consentians and Thurians returned to the protection of the Roman people.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> And more would have done the same, had not
                    Titus Pomponius Veientanus, praefect of the allies, having acquired the
                    appearance of a regular general, in consequence of several successful predatory
                    expeditions in the Bruttian territory, got together a tumultuary band, and
                    fought a battle with Hanno. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In that battle, a
                    great number of men, consisting, however, of a disorderly rabble of slaves and
                    rustics, were slain or captured. The least part of the loss was, that the
                    prefect himself was taken prisoner; for he was not only in the present instance
                    guilty of having rashly engaged the enemy, but previously, in <pb n="957"
                        xml:id="p.957"/> the capacity of farmer of the revenue, by iniquitous
                    practices of every description, had shown himself faithless and injurious to the
                    state, as well as the companies. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Among the
                    Lucanians, the consul, Sempronius, fought several small battles, but none worthy
                    of being recorded; he also took several inconsiderable towns. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> In proportion as the war was protracted, and the sentiments
                    no less than the circumstances of men fluctuated accordingly as events flowed
                    prosperously or otherwise, the citizens were seized with such a passion for
                    superstitious observances, and those for the most part introduced from foreign
                    countries, that either the people or the gods appeared to have undergone a
                    sudden change. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> And now the Roman rites were
                    growing into disuse, not only in private, and within doors, but in public also;
                    in the forum and Capitol there were crowds of women sacrificing, and offering up
                    prayers to the gods, in modes unusual in that country. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> A low order of sacrificers and soothsayers had enslaved
                    men's understandings, and the numbers of these were increased by the country
                    people, whom want and terror had driven into the city, from the fields which had
                    lain uncultivated during a protracted war, and had suffered from the incursions
                    of the enemy, and by the profitable trading in the ignorance of others which
                    they carried on like an allowed and customary trade. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> At first, good men gave utterance in private to the
                    indignation they felt at these proceedings; but afterwards the thing came before
                    the fathers, and formed a matter of public complaint. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> The aediles and triumviri, appointed for the execution of
                    criminals, were severely reprimanded by the senate for not preventing these
                    irregularities; but when they attempted to remove the crowd of persons thus
                    employed from the forum, and to overthrow their preparations for their sacred
                    rites, they narrowly escaped personal injury. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    It being now evident, that the evil was too powerful to be checked by inferior
                    magistrates, the senate commissioned Marcus Atilius, the city praetor, to rid
                    the people of these superstitions. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> He called
                    an assembly, in which he read the decree of the senate, and gave notice, that
                    all persons who had any books of divination, or forms of prayer, or any written
                    system of sacrificing, should lay all the aforesaid books and writings before
                    him before the calends of April; and that no person should sacrifice in any
                    public or consecrated place according to new or foreign rites. <pb n="958"
                        xml:id="p.958"/>
                </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Several of the public priests too died this
                    year: Lucius Cornelius Lentulus, chief pontiff, Caius Papirius Maso, son of
                    Caius, a pontiff, Publius Furius Philo, an augur, and Caius Papirius Maso, son
                    of Lucius, a decemvir for the superintendence of sacred rites. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> In lieu of Lentulus, Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, in lieu of
                    Papirius Cnaeius, Servilius Caepio, were created pontiffs. Lucius Quinctius
                    Flaminius was created augur, and Lucius Cornelius Lentulus decemvir for the
                    superintendence of sacred rites. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The time for
                    the election of consuls was now approaching; but as it was not thought proper to
                    call the consuls away from the war with which they were intently occupied,
                    Tiberius Sempronius, the consul, nominated Caius Claudius Centho as dictator to
                    hold the election. He appointed Quintus Fulvius Flaccus as his master of the
                    horse. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> On the first day on which the election
                    could be held, the dictator appointed as consuls, Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, his
                    master of the horse, and Appius Claudius Pulcher, who had held the government of
                    Sicily as praetor. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The praetors created were
                    Cneius Fulvius Flaccus, Caius Claudius Nero, Marcus Junius Silanus, Publius
                    Cornelius Sulla. The election completed, the dictator retired from his office.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> This year, Publius Cornelius Scipio,
                    afterwards surnamed Africanus, held the office of curule aedile, with Marcus
                    Cornelius Cethegus; and when the tribunes of the people opposed his pretensions
                    to the aedileship, alleging, that no notice ought to be taken of him, because he
                    had not attained the legal age for candidateship, he observed, <quote>if the
                        citizens in general are desirous of appointing me aedile, I am old
                        enough.</quote>
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Upon this the people ran to their respective
                    tribes to give their votes, with feelings so strongly disposed in his favour,
                    that the tribunes on a sudden abandoned their attempt. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The largesses bestowed by the aediles were the following:
                    the Roman games were sumptuously exhibited, considering the present state of
                    their resources; they were repeated during one day, and a gallon of oil was
                    given to each street. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Lucius Villius Tapulus,
                    and Marcus Fundanius Fundulus, the plebeian aediles, accused some matrons of
                    misconduct before the people, and some of them they convicted and sent into
                    exile. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The plebeian games were repeated
                    during two days, and a feast in honour of Jupiter was celebrated on occasion of
                    the games. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Quintus Fulvius Flaccus, for the third time,
                    and Appius <pb n="959" xml:id="p.959"/> Claudius entered upon the office of
                    consuls. The praetors determined their provinces by lot. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Publius Cornelius Sulla received both the city and the
                    foreign jurisdiction, formerly allotted to two persons; Cneius Fulvius Flaccus,
                    Apulia, Caius Claudius Nero, Suessula, and Marcus Junius Silanus, Tuscany.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> To the consuls the conduct of the war with
                    Hannibal was decreed with two legions each; one taking the troops of Quintus
                    Fabius, the consul of the former year, the other those of Fulvius Centumalus.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Of the praetors, Fulvius Flaccus was to
                    have the legions which were in Luceria under Aemilius the praetor, Nero Claudius
                    those in Picenum under Caius Terentius; each raising recruits for himself to
                    fill up the number of his troops. To Marcus Junius the city legions of the
                    former year were assigned, to be employed against the Tuscans. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Tiberius Sempronius Gracchus and Publius Sempronius
                    Tuditanus were continued in command in their provinces of Lucania and Gaul with
                    the armies they had, as was also Publius Lentulus in that part of Sicily which
                    formed the ancient Roman province. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Marcus
                    Marcellus had Syracuse, and that which was the kingdom of Hiero. Titus Otacilius
                    was continued in the command of the fleet, Marcus Valerius in that of Greece,
                    Quintus Mucius Scaevola in that of Sardinia. The Cornelii, Publius and Cneius,
                    were continued in the command of Spain. In addition to the armies already
                    existing, two legions for the service of the city were levied by the consuls,
                    and a total of twenty-three legions was made up this year. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> The levy of the consuls was impeded by the conduct of
                    Marcus Posthumius Pyrgensis, almost accompanied with a serious disturbance.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Posthumius was a farmer of the revenue,
                    who, for knavery and rapacity, practised through a course of many years, had no
                    equal except Titus Pomponius Veientanus, who had been taken prisoner the former
                    year by the Carthaginians under the conduct of Hanno, while carelessly ravaging
                    the lands in Lucania. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> As the state had taken
                    upon itself the risk of any loss which might arise from storms to the
                    commodities conveyed to the armies, not only had these two men fabricated false
                    accounts of shipwrecks, but even those which had really occurred were occasioned

                    When the day arrived for arguing the question, the people assembled in such

                    having been gone through, the only hope of safety which presented itself was,

                    before the tribes were called to give their votes. The witnesses having been
                    produced, the tribunes caused the people to withdraw, and the urn was brought,

                    activity of body, and lightness of arms, he judged best adapted for the

                    rapid pace, pitched his camp about fifteen miles from Tarentum; and without
                    telling his soldiers even there, what was their destination, he only called them
                    together and admonished them to march all of them in the road, and not to suffer
                    any one to turn aside or deviate from the line; and above all, that they would
                    be on the watch, so as to catch the word of command, and not do any thing
                    without the order of their leaders; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> that in

                    few Numidian horsemen were devastating the fields, and had terrified the rustics
                    through a wide extent of country; at which intelligence the Roman prefect took
                    no further step than to order a division of his cavalry to go out the following

                    else on this account, that on the contrary, this excursion of the Numidians was

                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Early in the night Hannibal put his troops
                    in motion, and Philemenus, with his customary burden of prey taken in hunting,
                    was his guide. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The rest of the conspirators
                    waited the accomplishment of what had been concerted; and the agreement was,
                    that Philemenus, while bringing in his prey through the small gate by which
                        <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> he was accustomed to pass, should
                    introduce some armed men, while Hannibal in another quarter approached the gate
                    called Temenis, which faced the east, in that quarter which was towards the
                    continent, near the tombs which were within the walls. When he drew near to the
                    gate, Hannibal raised a fire according to agreement, which made a blaze; the
                    same signal was returned <pb n="969" xml:id="p.969"/> by Nico, and the fires
                    were extinguished on both sides. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Hannibal led
                    his troops on in silence to the gate. Nico suddenly fell upon the guards while
                    asleep, slew them in their beds, and opened the gate. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> Hannibal then entered with his infantry, ordering his
                    cavalry to stay behind, that they might be able to bring their assistance
                    wherever it was required without obstruction. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Philemenus also in another quarter approached the small gate by which he was
                    accustomed to pass and repass. His voice, which was well known, for he said he
                    could scarcely bear the weight of the huge beast he had gotten, and his signal,
                    which had now become familiar, having roused the guard, the small gate was
                    opened. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> Two youths carrying in a boar,
                    Philemenus himself followed, with a huntsman, unencumbered, and while the
                    attention of the guard was incautiously turned upon those who carried the boar,
                    in consequence of its astonishing size, he transfixed him with a hunting spear.

                    to the forum, they joined Hannibal. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> The

                    the Romans were put to the sword on all hands. The townsmen were spared; but in
                    order to insure this, he instructed the Tarentine youths, when they saw any of

                    and at Cannae, and having at the same time inveighed against the haughty
                    domination of the Romans, desired that they would every one of them retire to

                    towards the city by a wall and ditch, and consequently that it could not be
                    taken by assault or by works; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> lest the design
                    to protect the Tarentines should detain him from the prosecution of more

                    the citadel whenever they pleased against the Tarentines, if left without a
                    strong protecting force, he resolved to cut off the communication between the

                    attempting to obstruct the work; and if they should sally forth too eagerly,
                    that by killing many of <pb n="971" xml:id="p.971"/> them the strength of the
                    garrison would be so far reduced, that the Tarentines alone would be easily able
                    to defend themselves from them. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> After they had
                    begun, the Romans, suddenly throwing open the gate, rushed in upon the workmen.
                    The guard stationed before the works allowed itself to be driven back, in order
                    that their boldness might be increased by success, and that they might pursue
                    them when driven back, in greater numbers, and to a greater distance. <milestone
                        n="5" unit="section"/> Then on a signal given, the Carthaginians, whom
                    Hannibal kept in readiness for this purpose, sprang up on all sides; nor could
                    the Romans sustain the attack, but were prevented from precipitate flight by the
                    narrowness of the ground, by impediments occasioned in some places by the works
                    already commenced, in others by the preparations for the work. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Most of them were driven headlong into the ditch, and more
                    were killed in the flight than in the battle. After this the work was commenced
                    without any attempt to obstruct it. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> A large
                    ditch was formed, within which a rampart was thrown up. He prepared also to add
                    a wall at a small distance, and on the same side, that they might defend
                    themselves from the Romans even without a garrison. He, however, left them a
                    small force, at once for their protection and to assist in building the wall.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> The general himself, setting out with the
                    rest of his forces, pitched his camp at the river Galaesus, five miles from the

                    the work, which had gone on somewhat faster than he had anticipated, he
                    conceived a hope that the citadel might even be taken by storm; for it was not
                    protected by an elevated situation as the other parts were, but placed upon a
                    plain, and separated from the city only by a wall and ditch. <milestone n="10"

                    engine and work, a reinforcement sent from Metapontum inspired the Romans with
                    courage to assault the works of the enemy, by a sudden attack, under cover of
                    the night. Some of them they threw down, others they destroyed by fire, and thus
                    there was an end to Hannibal's attempts against the citadel in that quarter.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> His only remaining hope was in a siege;
                    nor did that afford a good prospect of success, because, occupying a citadel
                    which was placed on a peninsula and commanded the entrance of the harbour, they
                    had the sea open to them, while the city, on the contrary, was deprived of any
                    supplies by <pb n="972" xml:id="p.972"/> sea; and thus the besiegers were in
                    greater danger of want than the besieged. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Hannibal assembled the chief men of the Tarentines, and laid before them all the
                    present difficulties. He said, <quote> That he could neither discover any method
                        by which a citadel so well fortified could be taken, nor could he hope for
                        any favourable result from a siege, while the enemy was master of the sea;
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> but that if ships could be obtained,
                        by which the introduction of supplies might be prevented, the enemy would
                        either immediately evacuate it, or surrender themselves. </quote>
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> The Tarentines agreed with him; but were of
                    opinion, that <quote> he who gave the advice ought also to assist in carrying it
                        into execution; for if the Carthaginian ships were brought there from
                        Sicily, they would be able to effect it; <milestone n="15" unit="section"/>
                        but by what means could their own ships, shut up as they were in a confined

                    Waggons were immediately collected from every quarter and joined together;
                    machines were employed to haul the ships on shore, and the road was prepared, in

                    rampart in several parts at the-same time, but with many wounds and much loss of
                    soldiers. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The consul, therefore, assembling
                    the military tribunes, said they must desist from this inconsiderate enterprise;
                    and that it appeared to him to be the safer course, that the troops should be
                    led back to Beneventum for that day, and then on the following day to pitch his
                    camp close to that of the enemy, so that the Campanians could not quit it, nor
                    Hanno return to it; <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> and in order that that
                    object might be attained with the greater ease, that he should send for his
                    colleague and his army; and that they would direct their whole force on that
                    point. This plan of the general was disconcerted, after the signal began to
                    sound for a retreat, by the clamours of the soldiery, who despised so
                    pusillanimous an order. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Nearest to the gate of
                    the enemy's camp was a Pelignian cohort, whose commander, Vibius Accuaeus,
                    seizing the standard, threw it over the rampart. <milestone n="5" unit="section"
                    /> Then pronouncing a curse upon himself and his cohort, if the enemy got
                    possession of that standard, he rushed forward before the rest, and crossing the
                    ditch and rampart, burst into the camp of the enemy. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> The Pelignians were now fighting within the rampart, when
                    in another quarter Valerius Flaccus, a military tribune of the third legion,
                    taunting the Romans with cowardice for conceding to allies the honour of taking
                    the camp, Titus Pedanius, first centurion of the first century, snatched the
                    standard out of the hands of the standard-bearer, and cried out, <quote> Soon
                        shall this standard, and this centurion, be within the rampart of the enemy;
                            <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> let those follow who would prevent the
                        standard's being captured by the enemy. </quote> Crossing the ditch, he was
                    followed first by the men of his own maniple, and then by the whole legion.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> By this time the consul also, changing his
                    plan on seeing them crossing the rampart, began to incite and encourage his
                    soldiers, instead of calling them off; representing to them, how critical and
                    perilous was the situation of the bravest cohort of their allies, and a legion
                    of their countrymen. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> All, therefore, severally
                    exerting themselves to the utmost, regardless whether the <pb n="977"

                    thrown against them from all sides, the enemy opposing their arms and their
                    persons to obstruct them, made their way and burst in. Many who were wounded,
                    even those whose blood and strength failed them, pressed forward, that they
                    might fall within the rampart of the enemy. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    The camp, therefore, was taken in an instant, as if it had been situated upon
                    level ground, and not completely fortified. What followed was a carnage rather
                    than a battle. The troops of both sides being huddled together within the
                    rampart, above six thousand of the enemy were slain; above seven thousand,
                    together with the Campanians who fetched the corn, and the whole collection of
                    waggons and beasts of burden, were captured. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    There was also a great booty, which Hanno in his predatory excursions, which he
                    had been careful to make in every quarter, had drawn together from the lands of
                    the allies of the Romans. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> After throwing down
                    the camp of the enemy, they returned thence to Beneventum; and there both the

                    territory of Cere, whither intelligence of the loss of the camp had reached him,
                    with a small party of foragers, whom he happened to have with him, returned to

                    eye to the citadel of Tarentum, and the garrison besieged therein. Caius
                    Servilius, lieutenant-general, having been sent, according to the advice of the
                    fathers, by Publius Cornelius, the praetor, to purchase corn in Etruria, made
                    his way into the harbour of Tarentum, through the guard-ships of the enemy, with
                    some ships of burden. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> At his arrival, those

                    the enemy, in conferences, to pass over to them, now, on the contrary, were the
                    persons to invite and solicit the enemy to come over to them; and now, as the
                    soldiers who were at Metapontum had been brought to assist in guarding the
                    citadel of Tarentum, the garrison was sufficiently powerful. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> In consequence of this measure, the Metapontines, being
                    freed from the fears which had influenced them, immediately revolted to
                    Hannibal. The people of Thurium, situated on the same coast, did the same.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They were influenced not more by the
                    defection of the Metapontines and Tarentines, with whom they were connected,
                    being sprung from the same country, Achaia, than by resentment towards the
                    Romans, in consequence of the recent execution of the hostages. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The friends and relations of these hostages sent a letter
                    and a message to Hanno and Mago, who were not far off among the Bruttii, to the
                    effect, that if they brought their troops up to the walls, they would deliver
                    the city into their hands. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Marcus Atinius was
                    in command at Thurium, with a small garrison, who they thought might easily be
                    induced to engage rashly in a battle, not from any confidence which he reposed
                    in his troops, of which he had very few, but in the youth of Thurium, whom he
                    had purposely formed into centuries, and armed against emergencies of this kind.
                        <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The generals, after dividing their forces
                    between them, entered the territory of Thurium; and Hanno, with a body of
                    infantry, proceeded towards the city in hostile array. Hanno staid behind with
                    the cavalry, under the cover of some hills, conveniently placed for the
                    concealment of an ambush. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Atinius, having by
                    his scouts discovered only the body of infantry, led his troops into the field,

                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The engagement with the infantry was
                    particularly dull, a few Romans in the first rank engaging, <pb n="979"

                    The Carthaginian line retreated, on purpose that they might draw the incautious
                    enemy to the back of the hill, where their cavalry were lying in ambush; and
                    when they had come there, the cavalry rising up on a sudden with a shout,
                    immediately put to flight the almost undisciplined rabble of the Thurians, not
                    firmly attached to the side on which they fought. <milestone n="13"

                    the battle for a considerable time; but at length even they were compelled to
                    turn their backs, and fled towards the city. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    There the conspirators, forming themselves into a dense body, received the

                    would enter the city mingled with them, unless they speedily closed the gates.
                    Thus they shut out the Romans, and left them to be cut up by the enemy.
                        <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> Atinius, however, and a few others were
                    taken in. After this for a short time there was a division between them, some
                    being of opinion that they ought to defend the city, others that they ought,
                    after all that had happened, to yield to fortune, and deliver up the city to the
                    conquerors; but, as it generally happens, fortune and evil counsels prevailed.

                    the Carthaginians into the city. The consuls led their legions from Beneventum
                    into the Campanian territory, with the intention not only of destroying the

                    informed of this, thinking that a friendly and familiar interview was requested,
                    and the memory of their private connexion remaining even amidst the disruption

                    mounted his horse, and addressing Badius by name, called him out to the combat.

                    After the battle had commenced, the Roman line was distressed chiefly from the

                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The next day Hannibal, having received
                    intelligence that the camp of the Romans was deserted, and that they had gone
                    off in different directions in two divisions, doubtful at first which he should
                    follow, commenced the pursuit of Appius; who, after leading him about whichever

                        unit="section"/> Hannibal, while in this quarter, had another opportunity of

                    could be entertained of the issue of a contest which was to take place between

                    one of which had grown old in victory, the other entirely inexperienced, and for

                    more than two hours, the Roman troops acting with the greatest spirit as long as

                    fallen, for he continually exposed himself to the weapons of the enemy, not only
                    from regard to his former character, but through fear of the disgrace which
                    would attach to him if he survived a disaster occasioned by his own temerity,
                    the Roman line was immediately routed. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> But so
                    completely were they prevented from flying, every way being beset by the

                    success, both himself and his soldiers, being glutted with booty, had so given
                    themselves up to licentiousness and indolence, that all military discipline was

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The Roman legions, and the praetor, Fulvius,
                    were in the neighbourhood of Herdonia, where, receiving intelligence of the
                    approach of the enemy, they had nearly torn up the standards and gone out to
                    battle without the praetor's orders; nor did any thing tend more to prevent it
                    than the assured hope they entertained that they could do so whenever they
                    pleased, consulting only their own will. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The
                    following night, Hannibal having obtained information that the camp was in a
                    state of tumult, and that most of the troops were in a <milestone n="3??"
                        unit="section"/> disorderly manner urging the general to give the signal,
                    and calling out to arms, and therefore feeling convinced that an opportunity
                    presented itself for a successful battle, distributed three thousand light
                    troops in the houses in the neighbourhood, and among the thorns and woods.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> These, on a signal being given, were to
                    rise up from their lurking-place with one accord; and Mago, with about two
                    thousand horse, was ordered to occupy all the roads in the direction in which he
                    supposed their flight would be directed. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Having made these preparations during the night, he led his troops into the
                    field at break of day. Nor did Fulvius decline the challenge; not so much from
                    any hope of success entertained by himself, as drawn by the blind impetuosity of
                    his soldiers. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Accordingly, the line itself was
                    formed with the same want of caution with which they entered the field,
                    agreeably to the whim of the soldiers, who came up as chance directed, and took
                    their stations just where they pleased; which they afterwards abandoned, as fear
                    or caprice suggested. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The first legion and the
                    left wing of the allied troops were drawn up in front. The line was extended to
                    a great length, the tribunes remonstrating, that there was no strength in it,
                    and that wherever the enemy made the charge they would break through it: but no
                    salutary advice reached their minds, nor even their ears. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Hannibal was now come up, a general of a totally different
                    character, with an army neither similar in its nature, nor similarly marshalled.
                    The consequence was, that the Romans did not so much as sustain their shout and
                    first attack. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Their general, equal to
                    Centenius in folly and temerity, but by no means to be compared with him in
                    courage, when he saw <pb n="988" xml:id="p.988"/> things going against him, and
                    his troops in confusion, hastily mounting his horse, fled from the field with
                    about two hundred horsemen. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The rest of the
                    troops, beaten in front, and surrounded on the flank and rear, were slaughtered
                    to such a degree, that out of eighteen thousand men, not more than two thousand
                    escaped. The enemy got possession of the camp. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When these disastrous defeats, happening one
                    upon another, were reported at Rome, great grief and consternation seized the
                    city. But still, as the consuls had been hitherto successful when it was most
                    important, they were the less affected by these disasters. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> Caius Laetorius and Marcus Metilius were sent as
                    ambassadors to the consuls, with directions carefully to collect the remains of
                    the two armies, and use every endeavour to prevent their surrendering themselves
                    to the enemy, through fear or despair, (which was the case after the battle of
                    Cannae,) and to search for the deserters from the army of volunteer slaves.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Publius Cornelius was charged with the
                    same business; to him also the levy was intrusted. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> He caused an order to be issued throughout the market and
                    smaller towns, that search should be made for the volunteer slaves, and that
                    they should be brought back to their standards. All these things were executed
                    with the most vigilant care. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The consul,
                    Appius Claudius, having placed Decius Junius in command at the mouth of the
                    Vulturnus, and Marcus Aurelius Cotta at Puteoli, with directions to send off the
                    corn immediately to the camp, as each of the ships from Etruria and Sardinia
                    arrived with it, returned himself to Capua, and found his colleague <milestone
                        n="6??" unit="section"/> Quintus Fulvius at Casilinum, conveying every
                    requisite thence, and making every preparation for the siege of Capua.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Both of them then joined in besieging the
                    city, summoning Claudius Nero, the praetor, from the Claudian camp at Suessula;
                    who, leaving a small garrison there, marched down to Capua with all the rest of
                    his forces. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Thus there were three generals'
                    tents erected round Capua; and three armies, applying themselves to the work in
                    different parts, proceeded to surround the city with a ditch and rampart,
                    erecting forts at moderate intervals. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The
                    Campanians attempting to obstruct the work, a battle was fought in several
                    places at once; the consequence of which was, that at length the Campanians
                    confined themselves within their gates and walls. <milestone n="10"
                        unit="section"/> Before, however, these works were carried quite <pb n="989"
                        xml:id="p.989"/> round, ambassadors were sent to Hannibal to complain that
                    Capua was abandoned, and almost given up to the Romans; and to implore him, that
                    he would now, at least, bring them assistance, when they were not only besieged,
                    but surrounded by a rampart. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> A letter was
                    sent to the consuls from Publius Cornelius, the praetor, directing that before
                    they completely enclosed Capua with their works, they should grant permission to
                    such of the Campanians as chose to quit Capua, and take their property with
                    them. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> That those should retain their liberty,
                    and all their possessions, who quitted it before the ides of March; but that
                    those who quitted it after that day, as well as those who continued there, would
                    be considered as enemies. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Proclamation was
                    made to the Campanians to this effect; but it was received with such scorn, that
                    they spontaneously used insulting language and menaces. Hannibal had marched his
                    legions from Herdonea to Tarentum, with the hope of getting possession of the
                    citadel of that place, by force or stratagem. <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    But not succeeding there, he turned his course to Brundusium, thinking that town
                    would be betrayed to him; but, while fruitlessly spending time there also, the
                    Campanian ambassadors came to him with complaints and entreaties. <milestone
                        n="15" unit="section"/> Hannibal answered them in a proud manner, that he
                    had before raised the siege of Capua, and that now the consuls would not sustain
                    his approach. <milestone n="16" unit="section"/> The ambassadors, dismissed with
                    these hopes, with difficulty effected their return to Capua, which was by this
                    time surrounded by a double trench and rampart. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> At the time when the circumvallation of Capua
                    was carrying on with the greatest activity, the siege of Syracuse, which had
                    been forwarded by intestine treachery, in addition to the efforts and bravery of
                    the general and his army, was brought to a conclusion. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> For in the beginning of spring, Marcellus being in doubt
                    whether he should direct the operations of the war against Himilco and
                    Hippocrates at Agrigentum, or press the siege of Syracuse; <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> though he saw that it was impossible to take the city by
                    force, which, from its situation, both with respect to sea and land, was
                    impregnable; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> nor by famine, as it was
                    supported by an uninterrupted supply of provisions from Carthage; yet that he
                    might leave no course untried, directed the Syracusan deserters (and there were
                    in the Roman camp some men in this situation of the highest <pb n="990"
                        xml:id="p.990"/> rank, who had been driven out of the city during the
                    defection from the Romans, because they were averse to a change of measures) to
                    sound the feelings of those who were of the same party in conferences, and to
                    promise them, that if Syracuse was delivered up, they should have their liberty,
                    and be governed by their own laws. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> There was
                    no opportunity, however, of having a conference; for as many were suspected of
                    disaffection, the attention and observation of all were exerted, lest any thing
                    of the kind should occur unknown to them. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> One
                    of the exiles, who was a servant, having been allowed to enter the city in the
                    character of a deserter, assembled a few persons, and opened a conversation upon
                    the subject. After this, certain persons, covering themselves with nets in a
                    fishing smack, were in this way conveyed round to the Roman camp, and conferred
                    with the fugitives. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The same was frequently
                    repeated by different parties, one after another; and at last they amounted to
                    eighty. But after every thing had been concerted for betraying the city, the
                    plot was reported to Epicydes, by one Attalus, who felt hurt that he had not
                    been intrusted with the secret; and they were all put to death with torture.
                    This attempt having miscarried, another hope was immediately raised. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> One Damippus, a Lacedaemonian, who had been sent from
                    Syracuse to king Philip, had been taken prisoner by the Roman fleet. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/> Epicydes was particularly anxious to ransom this man
                    above any other; nor was Marcellus disinclined to grant it; the Romans, even at
                    this time, being desirous of gaining the friendship of the Aetolians, with whom
                    the Lacedaemonians were in alliance. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Some
                    persons having been sent to treat respecting his ransom, the most central and
                    convenient place to both parties for this purpose appeared to be at the
                    Trogilian port, near the tower called Galeagra. <milestone n="11" unit="section"
                    /> As they went there several times, one of the Romans, having a near view of
                    the wall, and having determined its height, as nearly as it could be done by
                    conjecture, from counting the stones, and by forming an estimate, in his own
                    mind, what was the height of each stone in the face of the work; <milestone
                        n="12" unit="section"/> and having come to the conclusion that it was
                    considerably lower than he himself and all the rest had supposed it, and that it
                    was capable of being scaled with ladders of moderate size, laid the matter
                    before Marcellus. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> It appeared a thing not to
                    be neglected; but as the spot could not be ap- <pb n="991" xml:id="p.991"/>
                    proached, being on this very account guarded with extraordinary care, a
                    favourable opportunity of doing it was sought for. <milestone n="14"
                        unit="section"/> This a deserter suggested, who brought intelligence that
                    the Syracusans were celebrating the festival of Diana; that it was to last three
                    days, and that as there was a deficiency of other things during the siege, the
                    feasts would be more profusely celebrated with wine, which was furnished by
                    Epicydes to the people in general, and distributed through the tribes by persons
                    of distinction. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> When Marcellus had received
                    this intelligence, he communicated it to a few of the military tribunes; then
                    having selected, through their means, such centurions and soldiers as had
                    courage and energy enough for so important an enterprise, and having privately
                    gotten together a number of scaling-ladders, he directed that a signal should be
                    given to the rest of the troops to take their refreshment, and go to rest early,
                    for they were to go upon an expedition that night. <milestone n="16"
                        unit="section"/> Then the time, as it was supposed, having arrived, when,
                    after having feasted from the middle of the day, they would have had their fill
                    of wine, and have begun to sleep, he ordered the soldiers of one company to
                    proceed with the ladders, while about a thousand armed men were in silence
                    marched to the spot in a slender column. <milestone n="17" unit="section"/> The
                    foremost having mounted the wall, without noise or confusion, the others
                    followed in order; the boldness of the former inspiring even the irresolute with
                    courage. </p>
                <milestone n="24" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The thousand armed men had now taken a part of
                    the city, when the rest, applying a greater number of ladders, mounted the wall
                    on a signal given from the Hexapylos. To this place the former party had arrived
                    in entire solitude; as the greater part of them, having feasted in the towers,
                    were either asleep from the effects of wine, or else, half asleep, were still
                    drinking. A few of them, however, they surprised in their beds, and put to the
                    sword. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> They began then to break open a postern
                    gate near the Hexapylos, which required great force; and a signal was given from
                    the wall by sounding a trumpet, as had been agreed upon. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> After this, the attack was carried on in every quarter, not
                    secretly, but by open force; for they had now reached Epipolae, a place
                    protected by numerous guards, where the business was to terrify the enemy, and
                    not to escape their notice. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> In effect they
                    were terrified; for as soon as the sound of the trumpets was heard, <pb n="992"
                        xml:id="p.992"/> and the shouts of the men who <milestone n="5??"
                        unit="section"/> had got possession of the walls and a part of the city, the
                    guards concluded that every part was taken, and some of them fled along the
                    wall, others leaped down from it, or were thrown down headlong by a crowd of the
                    terrified townsmen. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> A great part of the
                    inhabitants, however, were ignorant of this disastrous event, all of them being
                    overpowered with wine and sleep; and because, in a city of so wide extent, what
                    was perceived in one quarter was not readily made known through the whole city.
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> A little before day, Marcellus having
                    entered the city with all his forces, through the Hexapylos, which was forced
                    open, roused all the townsmen; who ran to arms, in order, if possible, by their
                    efforts, to afford succour to the city, which was now almost taken. <milestone
                        n="8" unit="section"/> Epicydes advanced with a body of troops at a rapid
                    pace from the Insula, which the Syracusans themselves call Nasos, not doubting
                    but that he should be able to drive out what he supposed a small party, which
                    had got over the wall through the negligence of the guards. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> He earnestly represented to the terrified inhabitants who
                    met him, that they were increasing the confusion, and that in their accounts
                    they made things greater and more important than they really were. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> But when he perceived that every place around
                    Epipolae was filled with armed men, after just teazing the enemy with the
                    discharge of a few missiles, he marched back to the Achradina, not so much
                    through fear of the number and strength of the enemy, as that some intestine
                    treachery might show itself, taking advantage of the opportunity, and he might
                    find the gates of the Achradina and island closed upon him in the confusion.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> When Marcellus, having entered the walls,

                    have shed tears over it; partly from the inward satisfaction he felt at having
                    accomplished so important an enterprise, and partly in consideration of its
                    ancient renown. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The fleets of the Athenians

                    powerful tyrants and kings; but above all Hiero, a king who was not only fresh

                    occupied principally by deserters, who had no hopes of pardon in case of
                    capitulation. These men would neither suffer those who were sent to approach the

                    therefore, on the failure of this attempt, gave orders to retire to the

                    Philodemus, an Argive, who was placed in this situation by Epicydes. Marcellus
                    sent Sosis, one of the regicides, to him. After a long conversation, being put
                    off for the purpose of frustrating him, he brought back word to Marcellus, that
                    Philodemus had taken time to deliberate. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This

                    that if he should receive them into the fort, the Roman army, shut up as it was
                    within the walls, might be <milestone n="5??" unit="section"/> annihilated,
                    Marcellus, who saw that the Euryalus would neither be delivered up to him, nor
                    could be taken by force, pitched his camp between Neapolis and Tycha, which are
                    names of divisions of the city, and are in themselves like cities; fearful lest
                    if he entered populous parts of the city, he should not be able to restrain his
                    soldiers, greedy of plunder, from running up and down after it. <milestone n="6"

                    with fillets and other badges of supplicants, imploring him to abstain from fire

                    council respecting these entreaties, for so they were, rather than demands,
                    ordered his soldiers, according to the unanimous opinion of the council, not to
                    offer violence to any free person, but told them that every thing <pb n="994"

                    and parties of troops at the gates, which were exposed, as they faced the
                    streets, lest any attack should be made upon his camp while the soldiers were
                    dispersed in pursuit of plunder. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> After these
                    arrangements, on a signal given, the soldiers dispersed for that purpose; and
                    though they broke open doors and every place resounded in consequence of the

                    also, who despaired of obtaining assistance, having received a pledge that he
                    might return to Epicydes in safety, withdrew the garrison, and delivered up the

                    Euryalus, and placing a garrison in it, was freed from one cause of anxiety;
                    which was, lest any hostile force received into that fortress on his rear might
                    annoy his troops, shut up and confined as they were within the walls. <milestone
                        n="2" unit="section"/> He next invested the Achradina, erecting three camps
                    in convenient situations, with the hope of reducing those enclosed within it to
                    the want of every necessary. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The outposts of
                    both sides had remained inactive for several days, when the arrival of
                    Hippocrates and Himilco suddenly caused the Romans to be attacked aggressively
                    on all sides; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> for Hippocrates, having
                    fortified a camp at the great harbour, and given a signal to those who occupied
                    the Achradina, attacked the old camp of the Romans, in which Crispinus had the
                    command; and Epicydes sallied out against the outposts of Marcellus, the
                    Carthaginian fleet coming up to that <pb n="995" xml:id="p.995"/> part of the
                    shore which lay between the city and the Roman camp, so that no succour could be
                    sent by Marcellus to Crispinus. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The enemy,
                    however, produced more tumult than conflict; for Crispinus not only drove back
                    Hippocrates from his works, but pursued him as he fled with precipitation, while
                    Marcellus drove Epicydes into the city; and it was considered that enough was
                    now done even to prevent any danger arising in future from their sudden sallies.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They were visited too by a plague; a
                    calamity extending to both sides, and one which might well divert their
                    attention from schemes of war. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For as the
                    season' of the year was autumn, and the situation naturally unwholesome, though
                    this was much more the case without than within the city, the intolerable
                    intensity of the heat had an effect upon the constitution of almost every man in
                    both the camps. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At first they sickened and
                    died from the unhealthiness of the season and climate; but afterwards the
                    disease was spread merely by attending upon, and coming in contact with, those
                    affected; so that those who were seized with it either perished neglected and
                    deserted, or else drew with them those who sat by them and attended them, by
                    infecting them with the same violence of disease. Daily funerals and death were
                    before the eye; and lamentations were heard from all sides, day and night.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> At last, their feelings had become so
                    completely brutalized by being habituated to these miseries, that they not only
                    did not follow their dead with tears and decent lamentations, but they did not
                    even carry them out and bury them; <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> so that
                    the bodies of the dead lay strewed about, exposed to the view of those who were
                    awaiting a similar fate; and thus the dead were the means of destroying the
                    sick, and the sick those who were in health, both by fear and by the filthy
                    state and the noisome stench of their bodies. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Some preferring to die by the sword, even rushed alone upon the out-posts of the
                    enemy. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> The violence of the plague, however,
                    was much greater in the Carthaginian than the Roman army; for the latter, from
                    having been a long time before Syracuse, had become more habituated to the
                    climate and the water. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Of the army of the
                    enemy, the Sicilians, as soon as they perceived that diseases had become very
                    common from the unwholesomeness of the situation, dispersed to their respective
                    cities in the neighbourhood; <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> but the

                        <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> Marcellus, on seeing the violence with
                    which the disease was raging, had removed his troops into the city, where their
                    debilitated frames were recruited in houses and shade. Many, however, of the
                    Roman army were cut off by this pestilence. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The land forces of the Carthaginians being
                    thus destroyed, the Sicilians, who had served under Hippocrates, retired to two
                    towns of no great size, but well secured by natural situation and
                    fortifications; one was three miles, the other fifteen, from Syracuse. Here they
                    collected a store of provisions from their own states, and sent for
                    reinforcements. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Meanwhile, Bomilcar, who had
                    gone a second time to Carthage, by so stating the condition of their allies as
                    to inspire a hope that they might not only render them effectual aid, but also
                    that the Romans might in a manner be made prisoners in the city which they had
                    captured, induced the Carthaginians to send with him as many ships of burden as
                    possible, laden with every kind of provisions, and to augment the number of his
                    ships. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Setting sail, therefore, from Carthage
                    with a hundred and thirty men of war and seven hundred transports, he had
                    tolerably fair winds for crossing over to Sicily, but was prevented by the same
                    wind from doubling Cape Pachynum. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The news of

                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Epicydes, apprehensive lest if the same
                    wind which now detained him should continue to blow from the east for several
                    days, the Carthaginian fleet would return to Africa, put the Achradina in the
                    hands of the generals of the mercenary troops, and sailed to Bomilcar;
                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> whom he at length prevailed upon to try
                    the issue of a naval battle, though he <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> found
                    him with his fleet stationed in the direction of Africa, and afraid of fighting,
                    not so much because he was unequal in the strength or the number of his ships,
                    for he had more than the Romans, as because the wind was more favourable to the
                    Roman fleet than to his own. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Marcellus also
                    seeing that an army of Sicilians was assembling from every part of the island,
                    and that the Carthaginian fleet was approaching with a great want of supplies,
                    though inferior in the number of his ships, resolved to prevent Bomilcar from
                    coming to Syracuse, lest, blocked up in the city of his enemies, he should be
                    pressed both by sea and land. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The <pb n="997"
                        xml:id="p.997"/> two hostile fleets were stationed near the promontory of
                    Pachynum, ready to engage as soon as the sea should become calm enough to admit
                    of their sailing out into the deep. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly, the east wind, which had blown violently for several days, now
                    subsiding, Bomilcar got under sail first, his van seeming to make for the main
                    sea, in order to double the promontory with greater ease; <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> but seeing the Roman ships bearing down upon him, terrified
                    by some unexpected occurrence, it is not known what, he sailed away into the

                    Syracuse, that the island was deserted by the Carthaginians, and almost again
                    delivered up to the Romans; <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> after sounding the
                    inclinations of the besieged in conferences, they sent ambassadors to Marcellus,
                    to treat about terms of capitulation. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> They had
                    not much difficulty in coming to an agreement, that all the parts of the island
                    which had been under the dominion of their kings should be ceded to the Romans;
                    that the rest, with their liberty and their own laws, should be preserved to the
                    Sicilians. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They then invited to a conference
                    the persons who had been intrusted with the management of affairs by Epicydes;
                    to whom they said, that they were sent from the army of the Sicilians, at once
                    to Marcellus and to them, that both those who were besieged and those who were
                    not might share the same fortune; and that neither of them might stipulate any

                    then allowed to enter, in order to converse with their relations and friends;
                    when, laying before them the terms which they had made with Marcellus, and
                    holding out to them a hope of safety, they induced them to join with them in an
                    attack upon the praefects of Epicydes, Polyclitus, Philistion, and Epicydes,
                    surnamed Sindon. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Having put them to death,
                    they summoned the multitude to an assembly; and after complaining <pb n="998"

                    their dissatisfaction to each other in secret, they said, that <quote> although
                        they were pressed by so many calamities, they had no right to accuse
                        Fortune, because it was at their own option how long they should continue to
                        suffer them. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> That the motive which the
                        Romans had in besieging Syracuse was affection for the Syracusans, and not
                        hatred; for when they heard that the government was usurped by Hippocrates
                        and Epicydes, the creatures first of Hannibal and then of Hieronymus, they
                        took arms and began to besiege the city, in order to reduce not the city
                        itself, but its cruel tyrants. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But now
                        that Hippocrates is slain, Epicydes shut out of Syracuse, his praefects put
                        to death, and the Carthaginians driven from the entire possession of Sicily

                    any great crime; for the object was not that they should turn their arms against

                    was large enough to remunerate them for their service in it. At the same time
                    the mere rest from labour, the return to their homes, with the pleasure of

                    nothing to fear from the Romans, in consequence of the smallness of their

                        unit="section"/> It will indeed be the duty of all Roman generals to take
                    care, and the instances here recorded should be considered as strong arguments,
                    never to place so much confidence in foreign auxiliaries, as not to retain in
                    their camps a preponderance of their own strength, and of that force which is
                    properly their own. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The Celtiberians, suddenly
                    taking up their standards, marched away, replying only to the Romans, who asked
                    the cause of their departure and entreated them to stay, that they were called
                    away by a war at home. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Scipio seeing that his
                    allies could be detained neither by prayers nor force, and that he was neither a

                    every caution not to encounter the enemy any where on level ground. On his

                    Masinissa was a young man at that time an ally of the Carthaginians, whom

                    incessantly day and night, so as both to cut off his stragglers, who had gone
                    out <milestone n="4??" unit="section"/> to a distance from the camp in search of
                    wood and forage, and riding up to the very gates of his camp, and charging into

                    occasioned in the gates and rampart by his sudden attacks. Nor was there any
                    time or place at which the Romans were exempt from fear and anxiety; <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> and driven within their rampart, and deprived of
                    every necessary, they suffered in a manner a regular siege; and it appeared that
                    it would have been still straiter, if Indibilis, who it was reported was
                    approaching with seven thousand five hundred Suessetani, should form a junction
                    with the Carthaginians. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Scipio, though a wary
                    and provident general, overpowered by difficulties, adopted the rash measure of
                    going to meet Indibilis by night, with the intention of fighting him wherever he

                        unit="section"/> Leaving, therefore, a small force in his camp, under the
                    command of Titus Fonteius, lieutenant-general, he set out at midnight, and
                    meeting with the enemy, came to battle with him. The troops fought in the order
                    of march rather than of battle. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The Romans,
                    however, had the advantage, though in an irregular fight; but the Numidian
                    cavalry, whose observation the general supposed that he had escaped, suddenly
                    spreading themselves round his flanks, occasioned great terror. <milestone
                        n="10" unit="section"/> After a new contest had been entered into with the
                    Numidians, a third enemy came up in addition to the rest, the Carthaginian
                    generals having come up with their rear when they were now engaged in fighting.
                    Thus the Romans were surrounded on every side by enemies; nor could they make up
                    their minds which they should attack first, or in what part, forming themselves
                    into a close body, they should force their way through. <milestone n="11"
                        unit="section"/> The general, while fighting and encouraging his men,
                    exposing himself wherever the strife was the hottest, was run through the right
                    side with a lance; and when the party of the enemy, which, formed into a wedge,
                    had charged the troops collected round the general, perceived Scipio falling
                    lifeless from his horse, elated with joy, they ran shouting through the whole
                    line with the news that the Roman general had fallen. <milestone n="12"
                        unit="section"/> These words spreading in every direction, caused the enemy
                    to be considered as victors, and the Romans as vanquished. <milestone n="13"
                        unit="section"/> On the loss of the general the troops immediately began to
                    fly from the field; but though it was not difficult to force their way through
                    the Numidians and the other light-armed auxiliaries, yet it was scarcely
                    possible for them to escape so large a body of cavalry, and infantry equal to

                    the flight than in the battle; nor would a man have survived, had not night put

                    were not slow in following up their victory, immediately after the battle,
                    scarcely giving their soldiers necessary rest, hurry their army to Hasdrubal,
                    son of Hamilcar; confidently hoping, that after uniting their forces with his,
                    the war might be brought to a conclusion. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> On
                    their arrival, the warmest congratulations passed between the troops and their
                    generals, who were delighted with their recent victory; for they had not only

                    men, but looked forward to another victory of equal magnitude as a matter of
                    certainty. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The intelligence of this great
                    disaster had not yet reached the Romans; but there prevailed a kind of
                    melancholy silence and mute foreboding, such as is usually found in minds which
                    have a presentiment of impending calamity. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The
                    general himself, besides feeling that he was deserted by his allies, and that
                    the forces of the enemy were so much augmented, was disposed from conjecture and
                    reasoning rather to a suspicion that some defeat had been sustained, than to any

                        armies and generals of the enemy from forming a junction, he might himself
                        join his forces with his brother's. </quote> Disturbed with these cares, he
                    believed that the only safe policy for the present was to retire as far as
                    possible; <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> and, accordingly, he marched a
                    considerable distance thence in one night, the enemy not being aware of it, and
                    on that account continuing quiet. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> At dawn,
                    perceiving that their enemy had decamped, they sent the Numidians in advance,
                    and began to pursue them as rapidly as possible. The Numidians overtook them
                    before night, and charged, sometimes their rear, at other times their flanks.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> They then began to halt and defend
                    themselves as well as they could; but Scipio exhorted them at once to fight so
                    as not to expose themselves, and march at the same time, lest the infantry
                    should overtake them. </p>

                    halt, and night now <milestone n="2??" unit="section"/> drawing on, Scipio
                    recalled his troops from the battle, and collecting them, withdrew to a certain
                    eminence, not very safe, indeed, particularly for dispirited troops, but higher
                    than any of the surrounding places. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> There, at
                    first, his infantry, drawn up around his baggage and cavalry, which were placed
                    in their centre, had no difficulty in repelling the attacks of the charging
                    Numidians; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> but afterwards, when three generals
                    with three regular armies marched up in one entire body, and it was evident that
                    his men would not be able to do much by arms in defending the <pb n="1007"
                        xml:id="p.1007"/> position without fortifications, the general began to look
                    about, and consider whether he could by any means throw a rampart around;
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> but the hill was so bare, and the soil so
                    rough, that neither could a bush be found for cutting a palisado, nor earth for
                    making a mound, nor the requisites for making a trench or any other work;
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> nor was the place naturally steep or
                    abrupt enough to render the approach and ascent difficult to the enemy, as it
                    rose on every side with a gentle acclivity. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    However, that they might raise up against them some semblance of a rampart, they
                    placed around them the panniers tied to the burdens, building them up as it were
                    to the usual height, and when there was a deficiency of panniers for raising it,
                    they presented against the enemy a heap of baggage of every kind. The
                    Carthaginian armies coming up, very easily marched up the eminence, but were
                    stopped by the novel appearance of the fortification, as by something
                    miraculous, when their leaders called out from all sides, asking <quote> what
                        they stopped at? <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> and why they did not tear
                        down and demolish that mockery, which was scarcely strong enough to impede
                        the progress of women and children; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> that
                        the enemy, who were skulking behind their baggage, were, in fact, captured
                        and in their hands. </quote> Such were the contemptuous reproofs of their
                    leaders. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But it was not an easy task either
                    to leap over or remove the burdens raised up against them, or to cut through the
                    panniers, closely packed together and covered completely with baggage.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> When the removal of the burdens had
                    opened a way to the troops, who were detained by them for a long time, and the

                        <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> the Romans were cut to pieces on all
                    hands, the few by the many, the dispirited by the victorious. A great number of
                    the men, however, having fled for refuge into the neighbouring woods, effected
                    their escape to the camp of Publius Scipio, which Titus Fonteius commanded.
                        <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Some authors relate that Cneius Scipio
                    was slain on the eminence on the first assault of the enemy; others that he
                    escaped with a few attendants to a castle near the camp; this, they say, was
                    surrounded with fire, by which means the doors which they could not force were
                    consumed; that it was thus taken, and all within, together with the general

                    occasioned by their death was not more intense than that which was felt

                    Spain they mourned and regretted the generals themselves; Cneius, however, the
                    more, because he had been longer in command of them, had first engaged their
                    affections, and first exhibited a specimen of Roman justice and forbearance. </p>

                        why they had given themselves up to womanish and unavailing lamentations
                        rather than summon up all their courage to protect themselves and the

                    suddenly, as the army had been almost annihilated; what could have inspired men
                    who had been vanquished and routed with such boldness and confidence in
                    themselves; what general could have arisen now that the two Scipios were slain;
                    who could command the camp, and who had given the signal for battle; in
                    consequence of these so many and so unexpected circumstances, at first, being in
                    a state of complete uncertainty and amazement, they gave ground; <milestone

                    there would have been a dreadful slaughter of the flying enemy, or a rash and
                    dangerous effort on the part of the pursuers, had not Marcius promptly given the
                    signal for retreat, and by throwing himself in the way of the front rank, and
                    even holding some back with his own hands, repressed the infuriated troops. He
                    then led them back to the camp, still eager for blood and slaughter. <milestone

                    to fly with precipitation from the rampart of their enemy, saw that no one
                    pursued them, concluding that they had stopped from fear, now on the other hand
                    went away to their camp at an easy pace, with feelings of contempt for the

                    having ascertained this, addressed his mind to a measure which on the first view

                    was, aggressively to assault the enemy's camp, concluding that the camp of

                        which I might have the strongest reason for believing they would have

                        from the severest storms of fortune. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Now
                        since you have dared so much of your own accord, I have a mind to try how

                        gave the signal for retreat while you were pursuing the routed enemy with
                        precipitation, I did not wish to break your spirit, but to reserve it for
                        greater glory and more advantageous opportunities; <milestone n="12"
                            unit="section"/> that you might afterwards, when prepared and armed,
                        seize an occasion of attacking your enemy while off their guard, unarmed,
                        and even buried in sleep. Nor do I entertain the hope of gaining an
                        opportunity of this kind rashly, but from the actual state of things.
                            <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Doubtless, if any one should ask even
                        himself, by what means, though few in number and disheartened by defeat, you
                        defended your camp against troops superior in number and victorious, you
                        would give no other answer than that, as this was the very thing you were
                        afraid of, you had kept every place secured by works and yourselves ready

                        happens: men are least secure against that which fortune causes not to be

                        necessary to be cared about. <milestone n="15" unit="section"/> There is
                        nothing whatever which the enemy fear less at the present time, than lest
                        we, who were a little while ago besieged and assaulted, should aggressively
                        assault their camp ourselves. Let us dare, then, to do that which it is
                        incredible we should have the courage to attempt; it will be most easy from

                        among men, torpid with sleep, terrified at the unexpected tumult, and
                        overpowered while lying defenceless in their beds, from which you were so
                        grieved to be recalled yesterday. <milestone n="18" unit="section"/> I know
                        that the measure appears to you a daring one; but in difficult and almost
                        desperate circumstances the boldest counsels are always the safest. For if
                        when the critical moment has arrived, the opportunity of seizing which is of
                        a fleeting nature, you delay ever so little, in vain do you seek for it
                        afterwards when it has been neglected. <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                        One army is near us; two more are not far off. We have some hopes if we make
                        an attack now; and you have already made trial of your own and their
                        strength. <milestone n="20" unit="section"/> If we postpone the time and

                        there is danger lest all the generals and all the forces should unite. Shall
                        we be able then to withstand three generals and three armies, whom Cneius
                        Scipio with his army unimpaired could not withstand? <milestone n="21"
                            unit="section"/> As our generals have perished by dividing their forces,
                        so the enemy may be overpowered while separated and divided. There is no
                        other mode of maintaining the war; let us, therefore, wait for nothing but
                        the opportunity of the ensuing night. <milestone n="22" unit="section"/> Now
                        depart, with the favour of the gods, and refresh yourselves, that,

                    proposed by their new general, they received with joy; and the more daring it

                    of the day was spent in getting their arms in readiness and recruiting their

                    with fire, shouting, and the sword, were in a manner bereaved of their senses,

                    troops of armed men: some hastened to the gates; others, as the passes were
                    blocked up, leaped over the rampart, and as each escaped they <milestone n="6??"

                    from that carnage, the Romans, after taking the nearer camp, ran over to the

                    of the disaster. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In this camp, as they were
                    far distant from the enemy, and as some had gone off just before day-light for
                    forage, wood, and plunder, they found every thing in a still more neglected and
                    careless state. Their arms only were placed at the outposts, the men being
                    unarmed, and either sitting and reclining upon the ground, or else walking up
                    and down before the rampart and the gates. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> On
                    these men, thus at their ease and unguarded, the Romans, still hot from the
                    recent battle, and flushed with victory, commenced an attack; no effectual

                    present all places, both sacred and profane, are despoiled; which at last
                    recoiled upon the Roman gods, and first upon that very temple which was so
                    choicely adorned by Marcellus. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For foreigners
                    were in the habit of visiting the temples dedicated by Marcellus near the Capuan
                    gate, on account of their splendid ornaments of this description, of which a
                    very small portion can be found. Embassies from almost all the states of Sicily
                    came to him. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> As their cases were different, so
                    were also the terms granted to them. Those who had either not revolted or had
                    returned to the alliance before the capture of Syracuse, were received and
                    honoured as faithful allies. Those who had been induced to submit through fear
                    after the capture of Syracuse, as vanquished, received laws from the conqueror.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The Romans, however, had still <pb
                        n="1015" xml:id="p.1015"/> remaining a war of no small magnitude at
                    Agrigentum, headed by Epicydes and Hanno, generals in the late war, and a third
                    new one sent by Hannibal in the room of Hippocrates, a Libyphœnician by nation,
                    and a native of Hippo, called by his countrymen Mutines; an energetic man, and
                    thoroughly instructed in all the arts of war under the tuition of Hannibal. To
                    this man the Numidian auxiliaries were assigned by Epicydes and Hanno.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> With these he so thoroughly overran the
                    lands of his enemies, and visited his allies with such activity, in order to
                    retain them in their allegiance, and for the purpose of bringing them seasonable
                    aid as each required it, that in a short time he filled all Sicily with his
                    fame, nor <milestone n="7??" unit="section"/> was greater confidence placed in
                    any one else by those who favoured the Carthaginian interest. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> Accordingly the Carthaginian and Syracusan generals, who
                    had been hitherto compelled to keep within the walls of Agrigentum, not more at
                    the advice of Mutines than from the confidence they reposed in him, had the
                    courage to go out from the walls, and pitched a camp near the river Himera.
                        <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> When this was announced to Marcellus, he
                    immediately advanced and sat down at a distance of about four miles from the
                    enemy, with the intention of waiting to see what steps they took, and what they
                    meditated. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> But Mutines allowed no room or
                    time for delay or deliberation, but crossed the river, and, charging the
                    outposts of his enemy, created the greatest terror and confusion. The next day,
                    in an engagement which might almost be called regular, he compelled his enemy to
                    retire within their works. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Being called away
                    by a mutiny of the Numidians, which had broken out in the camp, and in which
                    about three hundred of them had retired to Heraclea Minoa, he set out to appease
                    them and bring them back; and is said to have earnestly warned the generals not
                    to engage with the enemy during his absence. Both the generals were indignant at
                    this conduct, but particularly Hanno, who was before disturbed at his
                    reputation. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    <quote>Is it to be borne,</quote> said he, <quote> that a mongrel African should
                        impose restraints upon me, a Carthaginian general, commissioned by the
                        senate and people? </quote>
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Epicydes, who wished to wait, was prevailed
                    upon by him to agree to their crossing the river and offering battle; for, said
                    he, if they should wait for Mutines, and the battle should terminate
                    successfully, Mutines would certainly have the credit of it. <pb n="1016"

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> But Marcellus, highly indignant that he who
                    had repulsed Hannibal from Nola, when rendered confident by his victory at
                    Cannae, should succumb to enemies whom he had vanquished by sea and land,
                    ordered his soldiers immediately to take arms and raise the standards.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> While marshalling his army, ten Numidians
                    rode up rapidly from the enemy's line with information that their countrymen,
                    first induced by the same causes which brought on the mutiny, in which three
                    hundred of their number retired to Heraclea, and secondly, because <milestone
                        n="3??" unit="section"/> they saw their commander, just on the approach of a
                    battle, sent out of the way by generals who wished to detract from his glory,
                    would not take any part in the battle. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> This
                    deceitful nation made good their promise in this instance. Accordingly the
                    spirits of the Romans were increased by the intelligence, which was speedily
                    conveyed through the lines, that the enemy were abandoned by the cavalry, which
                    the Romans principally feared; <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> while at the
                    same time the enemy were dispirited, not only because they were deprived of the
                    principal part of their strength, but further, because they were afraid lest
                    they should themselves be attacked by their own cavalry. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Accordingly, there was no great resistance made: the first
                    shout and onset determined the business. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The
                    Numidians who stood quiet in the wings during the action, when they saw their
                    party turning their backs, accompanied them in their flight only for a short
                    time; but when they perceived that they were all making for Agrigentum with the
                    most violent haste, they turned off to the neighbouring towns round about,
                    through fear of a siege. Many thousand men were slain and captured, together
                    with eight elephants. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> This was the last battle
                    which Marcellus fought in Sicily, after which he returned victorious to
                    Syracuse. The year was now about closing; <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> the
                    senate therefore decreed that Publius Cornelius, the praetor, should send a
                    letter to Capua to the consuls, with directions that while Hannibal was at a
                    distance, and nothing of any great importance was going on at Capua, one of
                    them, if <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> they thought fit, should come to
                    Rome to elect new magistrates. On the receipt of the letter, the consuls
                    arranged it between themselves, that Claudius should hold the election, and
                    Fulvius remain at Capua. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> The consuls created
                    by Claudius were Cneius Fulvius Centumalus, and Publius Sulpicius Galba, the son
                    of Servius, who had never exercised <pb n="1017" xml:id="p.1017"/> any curule
                    magistracy. <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> After this Lucius Cornelius
                    Lentulus, Marcus Cornelius Cethegus, Caius Sulpicius, and Caius Calpurnius Piso,
                    were created praetors. <milestone n="13" unit="section"/> Piso had the city
                    jurisdiction; Sulpicius, Sicily; Cethegus, Apulia; Lentulus, Sardinia. The
                    consuls were continued in command for a year longer. </p>
