                    <p> Brutus binds the people by oath, never to suffer any king to reign at Rome,
                        obliges Tarquinius Collatinus, his colleague, to resign the consulship, and
                        leave the state; beheads some young noblemen, and among the rest his own and
                        his sister's sons, for a conspiracy to receive the kings into the city. In a
                        war against the Veientians and Tarquiniensians, he engages in single combat
                        with Aruns the son of Tarquin the Proud, and expires at the same time with
                        his adversary. The ladies mourn for him a whole year. The Capitol dedicated.
                        Porsena, king of Clusium, undertakes a war in favour of the Tarquins.
                        Bravery of Horatius Cocles, and of Mucius. Porsena concludes a peace on the
                        receipt of hostages. Conduct of Claelia. Ap. Claudius removes from the
                        country of the Sabines to Rome: for this reason the Claudian tribe is added
                        to the former number, which by this means are increased to twenty-one. A.
                        Posthumius the dictator defeats at the lake Regillus Tarquin the Proud,
                        making war upon the Romans with an army of Latins. Secession of the commons
                        to the Sacred Mount; brought back by Menenius Agrippa. Five tribunes of the
                        people created. Corioli taken by C. Martius; from that he is surnamed
                        Coriolanus. Banishment and subsequent conduct of C. M. Coriolanus. The
                        Agrarian law first made. Sp. Cassius condemned and put to death. Oppia, a
                        vestal virgin, buried alive for incontinence. The Fabian family undertake to
                        carry on that war at their own cost and hazard, against the Veientians, and
                        for that purpose send out three hundred and six men in arms, who were all
                        cut off. Ap. Claudius the consul decimates his army because he had been
                        unsuccessful in the war with the Veientians, by their refusing to obey
                        orders. An account of the wars with the Volscians, Aequians, and Veientians,
                        and the contests of the fathers with the commons. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> THE affairs, civil and military, of the Roman
                    people, henceforward free, their annual magistrates, and the sovereignty of the
                    laws, more powerful than that of men, I shall now detail. <milestone n="2"
                        unit="section"/> â€”The haughty insolence of the late king had caused this
                    liberty to be the more welcome: for the former kings reigned in such a manner
                    that they all in succession might be not undeservedly set down as founders of
                    the parts, at least of the city, which they added as new residences for the
                    population augmented by themselves. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Nor is
                    there a <pb n="80" xml:id="p.80"/> doubt but that the very same Brutus who
                    earned so much glory for expelling this haughty monarch, would have done so to
                    the greatest injury of the public weal, if, through an over-hasty desire of
                    liberty, he had wrested the kingdom from any of the preceding kings. <milestone
                        n="4" unit="section"/> For what would have been the consequence if that
                    rabble of shepherds and strangers, fugitives from their own countries, having,
                    under the protection of an inviolable asylum, found liberty, or at least
                    impunity, uncontrolled by the dread of regal authority, had begun to be
                    distracted by tribunician storms, and to engage <milestone n="5??"
                        unit="section"/> in contests with the fathers in a strange city, before the
                    pledges of wives and children, and love of the very soil, to which it requires a
                    length of time to become habituated, had united their affections. <milestone
                        n="6" unit="section"/> Their affairs not yet matured would have been
                    destroyed by discord, which the tranquil moderation of the government so
                    cherished, and by proper nourishment brought to such perfection, that, their
                    strength being now developed, they were able to produce the wholesome fruits of
                    liberty. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> But the origin of liberty you may
                    date from this period, rather because the consular authority was made annual,
                    than that any diminution was made from the kingly prerogative. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> The first consuls had all their privileges and ensigns of
                    authority, only care was taken that the terror might not appear doubled, by both
                    having the fasces at the same time. Brutus was, with the consent of his
                    colleague, first attended by the fasces, who had not been a more zealous
                    assertor of liberty than he was afterwards its guardian. <milestone n="9"
                        unit="section"/> First of all he bound over the people, whilst still
                    enraptured with their newly-acquired liberty, by an oath that they would suffer
                    no one to be king in Rome, lest afterwards they might be perverted by the
                    importunities or bribes of the royal family. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    Next in order, that the fulness of the house might produce more of strength in
                    the senate, he filled up the number of the senators, diminished by the king's
                    murders, to the amount of three hundred, having elected the principal men of the
                    equestrian rank; and from thence it is said the custom was derived of summoning
                    into the senate both those who were patres and those who were conscripti. <note
                        anchored="true" place="unspecified"> All were called <hi rend="italics"
                            >Patres conscripti.</hi> Scil. Patres et Conscripti, the conjunction
                        being omitted. Nieb. i. p. 517. </note>
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Forsooth they styled those who were elected
                    into the new senate Conscripti. It is wonderful how <pb n="81" xml:id="p.81"/>
                    much that contributed to the concord of the state, and to attach the affection
                    of the commons to the patricians. </p>
                <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Then attention was paid to religious matters,
                    and as some part of the public worship had been performed by the kings in
                    person, that they might not be missed in any respect, they elect a king of the
                    sacrifices. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> This office they made subject to
                    the pontiff, that honour being added to the name might be no infringement on
                    their liberty, which was now their principal care. And I know not whether by
                    fencing it on every side to excess, even in the most trivial matters, they may
                    not have exceeded bounds. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> For when there was
                    nothing else to offend, the name of one of the consuls became an object of
                    dislike to the state. <quote> That the Tarquinii had been too much habituated to
                        sovereignty; Priscus first commenced; that Servius Tullus reigned next; that
                        though an interval thus intervened, that Tarquinius Superbus, not losing
                        sight of the kingdom as the property of another, had reclaimed it by crime
                        and violence, as the hereditary right of his family. <milestone n="4"
                            unit="section"/> That Superbus being expelled, the government was in the
                        hands of Collatinus: that the Tarquinii knew not how to live in a private
                        station; the name pleased them not; that it was dangerous to liberty. </quote>
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> â€”Such discourses were at first gradually
                    circulated through the entire state by persons sounding their dispositions; and
                    the people, now excited by jealousy, Brutus convenes to a meeting. There first
                    of all he recites the people's oath: <quote> that they would suffer no one to be
                        king, nor any thing to be in Rome whence danger might result to liberty.
                            <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> That it ought to be maintained with
                        all their might, and nothing that could tend that way ought to be
                        overlooked; he said it with reluctance, for the sake of the individual; and
                        would not say it, did not his affection for the commonwealth predominate;
                        that the people of Rome do not believe that entire liberty has been
                        recovered; that the regal family, the regal name, was not only in the state
                        but even in the government; that was unfavourable, that was injurious to
                        liberty. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Do you, L. Tarquinius, </quote>
                    says he, <quote> do you, of your own accord, remove this apprehension. We
                        remember, we own it, you expelled the royal family; complete your kindness;
                        take hence the royal name â€”your property your fellow citizens shall not only
                        restore you, by my advice, but if any thing is wanting they will generously
                        supply. Depart in <pb n="82" xml:id="p.82"/> amity. Relieve the state from a
                        dread which is perhaps groundless. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> So
                        firmly are they persuaded in mind that only with the Tarquinian race will
                        kingly power depart hence. </quote> Amazement at so extraordinary and sudden
                    an occurrence at first impeded the consul's utterance; then, when he was
                    commencing to speak, the chief men of the state stand around him, and by many
                    importunities urge the same request. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Others
                    indeed had less weight with him. After Sp. Lucretius, superior in age and rank,
                    his father-in-law besides, began to try various methods, by entreating and
                    advising alternately, that he would suffer himself to be prevailed on by the
                    general feeling of <milestone n="10??" unit="section"/> the state, the consul,
                    apprehending lest hereafter these same things might befall him, when again in a
                    private station, together with loss of property and other additional disgrace,
                    he resigned his consulship; and removing all his effects to Lavinium, he
                    withdrew from the state. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Collatinus
                        is supposed to have earned the odium of the people, and his consequent
                        expulsion from Rome, by his endeavours to save his nephews, the Aquillii,
                        from punishment. </note>
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Brutus, according to a decree of the senate,
                    proposed to the people, that all the family of the Tarquins should be banished
                    from Rome; and in an assembly by centuries he elected P. Valerius, with whose
                    assistance he had expelled the kings for his colleague. </p>
                <milestone n="3" unit="chapter"/>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Though nobody doubted that a war was impending
                    from the Tarquins, yet it broke out later than was universally expected; but
                    liberty was well nigh lost by treachery and fraud, a thing they had never
                    apprehended. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> There were, among the Roman
                    youth, several young men of no mean families, who, during the regal government,
                    had pursued their pleasures without any restraint; being of the same age with,
                    and companions of, the young Tarquins, and accustomed to live in princely style.
                        <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Longing for that licentiousness, now that
                    the privileges of all were equalized, they complained that the liberty of others
                    has been converted to their slavery: <quote> that a king was a human being, from
                        whom you can obtain, where right, or where wrong may be necessary; that
                        there was room for favour and for kindness; that he could be angry, and
                        could forgive; that he knew the difference between a friend and an enemy;
                            <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> that laws were a deaf, inexorable
                        thing, more beneficial and advantageous for the poor than the rich; that
                        they allowed of no relaxation or indulgence, if <pb n="83" xml:id="p.83"/>

                    made a present to the Romans of his camp well stored with provisions conveyed
                    from the neighbouring and fertile fields of Etruria, the city being then

                    was then sold, and called the goods of Porsena, the expression rather importing
                    gratitude for the gift, than an auction of the king's property, which never even
                    was in the power of the Roman people. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Porsena,
                    after ending the Roman war, that his army might not seem to have been led into
                    these parts without effecting any thing, sent his son Aruns with a part of his

                    ventured to meet them in the field. At the commencement of the battle the

                    the Etrurians, when they had almost got the victory, were enclosed and cut to

                    After a short time, sufficient for curing their wounds and recruiting their

                    I find that Titus Lartius was appointed the first dictator, and Spurius Cassius
                    master of the horse. They chose men of consular dignity, for so the law, made
                    for the election of a dictator, ordained. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For
                    this reason, I am more inclined to believe that Lartius, who was of consular
                    rank, was annexed to the consuls as their director and master, rather than
                    Manius Valerius, the son of Marcus and grandson of Volesus, who had not yet been

                    dictator from that family in particular, they would much rather have chosen his
                    father, Marcus Valerius, a consular person, and a man of distinguished merit.

                    there now, as under the consuls who possessed equal power, the assistance of one
                    of the two, nor was there appeal, nor was there any resource any where but in
                    attentive submission. The creation of a dictator at Rome terrified the Sabines,

                    wounded in the side, he was carried off by a patty of his own men to a place of

                    as they advanced with hostile spears, that Aebutius was run through the arm and

                    them, commanded by Tarquin's son. This body, inasmuch as they fought with
                    greater fury from having been banished from their country, and lost their

                    family, that the slaying of the princes might belong to the same family whose

                    the dictator, on seeing so distinguished a man slain, the exiles advancing

                    peace nor war with the nation of the Volscians; for both the Volscians had

                    used by the Roman dictator, and the Roman employed this expedition that he might
                    not have to contend in one and the same battle with the Latin and the Volscian.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> In resentment of this, the consuls marched
                    their army into the Volscian territory; the unexpected proceeding alarmed the
                    Volscians, who dreaded no chastisement of mere intention; unmindful of arms,
                    they gave three hundred children of the principal men of Cora and Pometia as
                    hostages. Upon this the legions were withdrawn without coming to any action.

                    returned to the Volscians, now delivered of their fears; they again make secret
                    preparation for war, having taken the Hernicians into an alliance with them.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They send ambassadors in every direction
                    to stir up Latium. But the recent defeat received at the lake Regillus, could
                    scarcely restrain the Latins from offering violence to the ambassadors through
                    resentment and hatred of any one who would advise them to take up arms. Having
                    seized the Volscians, they brought them to Rome. They were there delivered up to
                    the consuls, and information was given that the Volscians and Hernicians were
                    making preparations for war against the Romans. <milestone n="5" unit="section"

                    that they both sent back six thousand prisoners to the Latins, and referred to
                    the new magistrates the business regarding the treaty, which had <pb n="105"

                    the Capitol as an offering to Jupiter. Along with the ambassadors and the
                    offering there came a great crowd, consisting of the prisoners who had been sent
                    back to their friends. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> They proceed to the

                    for their having been generously kept and treated during their calamity. They
                    then form connexions of hospitality. And never at any former time was the Latin

                    incurred greater danger by staying at home, or venturing abroad, they came at
                    length to the senate; but though the house was at length full, a want of
                    agreement manifested itself, not only among the fathers, but even between the

                    had interrupted their deliberation regarding that which was no doubt the

                    unless they first receive a recompence, nor consistent with the dignity of the

                    opposite course. And thus, by acting a middle part, he neither escaped the odium
                    of the people, nor gained the favour of the senators. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> The fathers looked upon him as a weak, popularity-hunting
                    consul, and the people considered him as a deceiver. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> And it soon appeared that he was as odious to them as
                    Appius himself. A dispute had happened between the consuls, as to which should
                    dedicate the temple of Mercury. The senate referred the affair from themselves
                    to the people, and ordained that to whichsoever of them the dedication should be
                    granted by order of the people, he should preside over the markets, establish a
                    company of merchants, and perform the functions of a pontifex maximus.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The people gave the dedication of the
                    temple to M. Laetorius, the centurion of the first legion, that it might plainly
                    appear to have been done not so much out of respect to a person on whom an
                    honour above his rank had been conferred, as to affront the consuls. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> Upon this one of the consuls particularly, and the
                    senators, were highly incensed. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> But the people
                    had acquired courage, and proceeded in a manner quite different from what they
                    had at first intended. For when they despaired of redress from the consuls and
                    senate, upon seeing a debtor led to the court, they flew together from all
                    quarters. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> And neither the decree of the consul
                    could be heard in consequence of the noise and clamour, nor, when he had
                    pronounced the decree, did any one obey it. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    All was managed by violence, and the entire dread and danger with respect to
                    personal liberty, was transferred from the debtors to the creditors, who were
                    severally abused by the crowd in the very sight of the consul. In addition to
                    all this, the dread of the Sabine war spread, and when a levy was decreed,
                    nobody gave in his name; Appius being enraged, and bitterly inveighing against
                    the ambitious arts of his colleague, who by his popular silence was betraying
                    the republic, and besides his not passing sentence against the debtors, likewise
                    neglected to raise the levies, after they <pb n="111" xml:id="p.111"/> had been
                    voted by the senate. <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> Yet he declared, that

                        authority altogether debased. That he alone would vindicate both his own

                    people; nor would the consul have allowed the appeal, because there was no doubt
                    regarding the judgment of the people, had not his obstinacy been with difficulty
                    overcome, rather by the advice and influence of the leading men, than by the

                    which was almost the same with that published by the consul Servilius,

                    were levied, a greater army than had ever been raised before. Each of the

                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Nor could the war be deferred any longer.
                    The Aequi had made incursions upon the Latin territory; the deputies of the

                    The Aequi retired from the plains, and depending more on the advantage of the

                    Accordingly they rushed on to the fight, in a careless manner, and as if

                    the enemy's shouts to be returned, he ordered them to stand still with their
                    spears fixed in the ground, and when the enemy came up, to draw their swords and

                    quest of it. So far had the hatred of their neighbours obliged them to stand in
                    need of aid from distant countries. When corn had been bought up at Cumae, the
                    ships were detained in lieu of the property of the Tarquinii by the tyrant

                    by some terror, even after it had abated, the Romans both augmented the number
                    of their colonists at Velitrae, and despatched a new colony to the mountains of

                        xml:id="p.128"/> their land were taken from them: of this the consul Cassius
                    was about to distribute one half among the Latins, the other half among the

                    considerable portion of land, which, though public property, he alleged was
                    possessed by private individuals. This proceeding alarmed several of the
                    senators, the actual possessors, at the danger of their property; the senators
                    felt, moreover, a solicitude on public grounds, that the consul by his donation
                    was establishing an influence dangerous to liberty. <milestone n="3"

                    resisted the donation, the senators seconding him, nor were all the commons
                    opposed to him; they had at first begun to despise a gift which was extended
                    from citizens to allies: <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> in the next place
                    they frequently heard the consul Virginius in the assemblies as it were
                    prophesying â€” "that the gift of his colleague was pestilential â€”that those lands
                    were sure to bring slavery to those who should receive them; that the way was
                    paving to a throne. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> For why was it that the
                    allies were included, and the Latin nation? What was the object of a third of
                    the land that had been taken being given back to the Hernici so lately our
                    enemies, except that instead of Coriolanus being their leader they may have
                    Cassius? <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The dissuader and opposer of the
                    agrarian law now began to be popular. Both consuls then vied with each other in
                    humouring the commons. Virginius said that he would suffer the lands to be
                    assigned, provided they were assigned to no one but to a Roman citizen.
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Cassius, because in the agrarian donation
                    he sought popularity among the allies, and was therefore lowered in the
                    estimation of his countrymen, in order that by another donation he might
                    conciliate their affections, ordered that the money received for the Sicilian
                    corn should be refunded to the people. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> That
                    indeed the people rejected as nothing else than a present bribe for regal
                    authority: so strongly were his gifts spurned in the minds of men, as if they
                    possessed every thing in abundance, in consequence of their inveterate
                    suspicions of his aiming at sovereign power. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    As soon as he went out of office, it is certain that he was condemned and put to
                    death. There are some who represent his father as the person who inflicted the
                    punishment: that <pb n="129" xml:id="p.129"/> he, having tried him at home,
                    scourged him and put him to death, and consecrated his son's private property to

                    decision of the people; that his house was demolished by a public decree: this

                    whether that trial was private or public, he was condemned in the consulship of

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The resentment of the people against Cassius
                    was not of long duration. The allurements of the agrarian law, now that its
                    proposer was gone, were of themselves gaining ground in their minds; and this
                    feeling was further heightened by the parsimonious conduct of the senators, who,
                    the Volsci and Aequi having been defeated that year, defrauded the soldiers of
                    the booty; whatever was taken from the enemy, the consul Fabius sold, and lodged
                    the proceeds in the treasury. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The Fabian name
                    was odious to the commons on account of the last consul: the senate however
                    succeeded in having Kaeso Fabius elected consul with L. Aemilius. <milestone
                        n="3" unit="section"/> The commons, still further incensed at this, stirred
                    up foreign war by exciting disturbance at home; civil dissensions were then
                    interrupted by war. The senators and commons uniting, under the conduct of
                    Aemilius, conquered in battle the Volsci and Aequi who renewed hostilities.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> The retreat, however, destroyed more of
                    the enemy than the battle; so perseveringly did the horse pursue them when
                    routed. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> During the same year, on the ides of
                    July, the temple of Castor was dedicated: it had been vowed during the Latin war
                    in the dictatorship of Posthumius: his son, who was elected duumvir for that
                    special purpose, dedicated it. In that year also the minds of the people were
                    excited by the charms of the agrarian law. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The
                    tribunes of th people were for enhancing the popular power (vested in them) by
                    promoting the popular law. The senators, considering that there was enough and
                    more than enough of frenzy in the multitude without any additional incitement,
                    viewed with horror largesses and all inducements to temerity: the senators found
                    in the consuls most energetic abettors in making resistance. <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> That portion of the commonwealth therefore pre- <pb n="130"

                    forthcoming year they succeeded in bringing in M. Fabius, Kaeso's brother, as
                    consul, and one still more detested by the commons for his persecution of Sp.
                    Cassius, L. Valerius. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> In that year also there
                    was a contest with the tribunes. The law proved to be a' vain project, and the
                    abettors of the law mere boasters, by their holding out a gift that was not
                    realized. The Fabian name was from thence held in high repute, after three
                    successive consulates, and all as it were uniformly exercised in contending with
                    the tribunes; accordingly, the honour remained for a considerable time in that
                    family, as being right well placed. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> A
                    Veientian war was then commenced; the Volscians, too, renewed hostilities; but
                    for foreign wars their strength was almost more than sufficient, and they abused
                    it by contending among themselves. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> To the
                    distracted state of the public mind were added prodigies from heaven, exhibiting
                    almost daily threats in the city and in the country, and the soothsayers,
                    consulted by the state and by private individuals, one while by means of
                    entrails, another by birds, declared that there was no other cause for the
                    divine anger, but that the ceremonies of religion were not duly attended to.
                        <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> These terrors, however, terminated in
                    this, that Oppia, a vestal virgin, being found guilty of a breach of chastity,

                    consuls. During this year the dissension at home was not abated, and the war
                    abroad was more desperate. Arms were taken up by the Aequans; the Veientes also
                    entered the territory of the Romans committing devastations; the solicitude
                    about which wars increasing, Kaeso Fabius and Sp. Fusius are created consuls.

                    when they ought to assuage, increased still further the bad feelings of the
                    commons: and the custom of declining the military service was now returning, not
                    of their own accord; but Sp. Licinius, a tribune of the people, thinking that
                    the time was come for forcing the agrarian law on the patricians by extreme
                    necessity, had taken on him the task of obstructing the military preparations.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> But all the odium of the tribunitian power
                    was turned on the author; nor did the consuls rise up against him <pb n="131"

                    assistance the consuls hold the levy. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> An army
                    is raised for the two wars at the same time; one is given to Fabius to be led
                    against the Aequi, the other to Furius against the Veientians. And with respect
                    to the Veientians, nothing was done worthy of mention. <milestone n="6"
                        unit="section"/> Fabius had much more trouble with his countrymen than with
                    the enemy: that one man himself, as consul, sustained the commonwealth, which
                    the army was betraying, as far as in them lay, through their hatred of the
                    consul. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> For when the consul, in addition to
                    his other military talents, which he exhibited amply in his preparations for and
                    conduct of war, had so drawn up his line that he routed the enemy's army solely
                    by a charge of his cavalry, the infantry refused to pursue them when routed:
                        <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> and though the exhortation of their
                    general, whom they hated, could not move them, neither could even their own
                    infamy, and the present public disgrace and subsequent danger, if the enemy
                    should recover courage, oblige them to quicken their pace, or even to stand in
                    order of battle, if nothing else. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> Without
                    orders they face about, and with a sorrowful air (you would suppose them beaten)
                    they return to the camp, execrating at one time their general, at another time
                    the services rendered by the cavalry. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Nor
                    were any remedies sought by the general for this so pestilent an example; so
                    true is it that the most distinguished talents are more likely to be deficient
                    in the tact of managing their countrymen than in that of conquering an enemy.

                    off unpunished; they were unwilling that success should accrue to the patricians

                        <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The consuls confer together as if to

                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/> If he deceived, he invokes the anger of

                    replied, that <quote> if the army could triumph without their general,
                            <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> he would readily accede to it in
                        consideration of their distinguished behaviour in that war: that for his own
                        part, his family being plunged in grief in consequence of the death of his
                        brother Q. Fabius, and the commonwealth being in some degree bereaved by the
                        loss of one of her consuls, he would not accept the laurel blasted by public
                        and private grief. </quote> The triumph thus resigned was more distinguished
                    than any triumph actually enjoyed; <milestone n="11" unit="section"/> so true it
                    is, that glory refused in due season sometimes returns with accumulated lustre.
                    He next celebrates the two funerals of his colleague and brother, one after the
                    other, he himself acting as panegyrist in the case of both, when by ascribing to
                    them his own deserts, he himself obtained the greatest share of them. And not
                    unmindful of that which he had conceived at the commencement of his consulate,
                    namely, the regaining the <milestone n="12" unit="section"/> affection of the
                    people, he distributes the wounded soldiers among the patricians to be cured.
                    Most of them were given to the Fabii: nor were they treated with greater
                    attention in any other place. From this time the Fabii began to be popular, and
                    that not by any practices except such as were beneficial to the state. </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> Accordingly Kaeso Fabius, having been elected
                    consul with T. Virginius not more with the zealous wishes of the senators than
                    of the commons, attended neither to wars, nor levies, nor any other object,
                    until the hope of concord being now in some measure commenced, the feelings of
                    the commons might be consolidated with those of the senators as soon as
                    possible. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Wherefore at the commencement of the
                    year he proposed: <quote> that before any tribune should stand forth as an
                        abettor of the agrarian law, the patricians themselves should be beforehand
                        with them in performing their duty; that they should distribute among the
                        commons the land taken from the enemy in as equal a proportion as possible;
                        that it was but just that those should obtain it, by whose blood and sweat
                            <pb n="138" xml:id="p.138"/> it was obtained. </quote>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> The patricians rejected the proposal with
                    scorn; some even complained that the once brilliant talents of Kaeso were now
                    becoming wanton, and were waning through excess of glory. <milestone n="4"
                        unit="section"/> There were afterwards no factions in the city. The Latins
                    were harassed by the incursions of the Aequi. Kaeso being sent thither with an
                    army, passes into the very territory of the Aequi to depopulate it. The Aequi
                    retired into the towns, and kept themselves within the walls: on that account no
                    battle worth mentioning was fought. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But a blow
                    was received from the Veientian foe through the temerity of the other consul;
                    and the army would have been all cut off, had not Kaeso Fabius come to their
                    assistance in time. From that time there was neither peace nor war with the
                    Veientians; their proceedings had now come very near to the form of that of
                    brigands. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> They retired from the Roman troops
                    into the city; when they perceived that the troops were drawn off, they made
                    incursions into the country, alternately evading war by quiet, quiet by war.
                    Thus the matter could neither be dropped altogether, nor brought to a
                    conclusion; and other wars were impending either at the moment, as from the
                    Aequi and Volsci, who remained inactive no longer than until the recent smart of
                    their late disaster should pass away; or it was evident that the Sabines, ever
                    hostile, and all Etruria would put themselves in motion: <milestone n="7"
                        unit="section"/> but the Veientians, a constant rather than a formidable
                    enemy, kept their minds in constant uneasiness by their insults more frequently
                    than by any danger apprehended from them; a matter which could at no time be
                    neglected, and which suffered them not to direct their attention to any other
                    object. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then the Fabian family addressed the
                    senate; the consul speaks in the name of the family: <quote> Conscript fathers,
                        the Veientian war requires, as you know, a constant rather than a strong
                        force. Do you attend to other wars: assign the Fabii as enemies to the

                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The warmest thanks were returned to them. The

                    they protected all their own districts and ravaged those of the enemy, spreading
                    their forces along both frontiers. There was afterwards an intermission, though
                    not of long duration, to these depredations: whilst both the Veientians, having

                    whilst the ranks are posting themselves behind their respective banners and they
                    are stationing their reserves, a brigade of Roman cavalry charging them suddenly
                    in flank, took away all opportunity not only of commencing the fight, but even
                    of standing their ground. Thus being driven back to the Red <milestone n="12"

                    sue for peace; for the obtaining of which they were sorry, from the natural

                    appeared mortifying and humiliating to the Veientians: then (they formed) a
                    design, suggested by the circumstance, of surprising their daring enemy by an
                    ambuscade; they were even glad that the confidence of the Fabii was increasing
                    by their great success. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> Wherefore cattle were
                    frequently driven in the way of the plundering parties, as if they had come
                    there by mere accident, and tracts of land were abandoned by the flight of the
                    peasants; and troops of armed men sent to prevent the devastations retreated

                    so far, that at the sight of some cattle at a distance from Cremera, with an
                    extensive plain lying between, they ran down to it (although few troops of the
                    enemy were observed); and when incautious and in disorderly haste they had
                    passed the ambuscade placed on either side of the very road; <milestone n="6"

                    carry off the cattle straying about, as is usual when they are frightened, the
                    Veientians rise up suddenly from their ambuscade, and the enemy were in front
                    and on every side. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> At first the shout that was
                    raised terrified them; then weapons assailed them from every side; and, the

                    compact body of soldiers, to contract their own circle within a narrower
                    compass; which circumstance rendered striking both their own paucity of numbers,
                    and the superior numbers of the enemy, the ranks being crowded in a narrow
                    space. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Then the plan of fighting, which they
                    had directed equally against every part, being now relinquished, they all

                    that direction straining every effort both with their bodies and arms, they
                    forced a passage by forming a wedge. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> The way
                    led to a hill of moderate acclivity; here they first halted: presently, as soon
                    as the higher ground afforded them time to gain breath, and to recover from so
                    great a panic, they repulsed them as they advanced up; and the small band by the

                    scarcity of provisions bearing hard upon them in addition to the war, (for the

                    Veientians declined an engagement. Ravages were committed, and they made
                    incursions in every direction on the Roman territory from the Janiculum as if

                    as that by which they had entrapped the Fabii: having pursued some cattle that
                    had been driven on designedly for the purpose of decoying them, they fell into
                    an ambuscade; in proportion as they were more numerous, the slaughter was
                    greater. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> The violent resentment resulting from
                    this disaster was the cause and commencement of one still greater: for having
                    crossed the Tiber by night, they attempted to assault the camp of the consul
                    Servilius; being repulsed from thence with great slaughter, they with difficulty
                    made good their retreat into the Janiculum. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    The consul himself also crosses the Tiber, fortifies his camp at the foot of the

                    because they were more expeditious, he rashly marched his army up the steep
                        <milestone n="8??" unit="section"/> of the Janiculum to the camp of the
                    enemy, and being repulsed from thence with more disgrace than he had repulsed
                    them on the preceding day, he was saved, both himself and his army, by the
                    intervention of his colleague. <milestone n="9" unit="section"/> The Etrurians
                    (hemmed in) between the two armies, when they presented their rear to the one
                    and the other by turns, were entirely cut off. Thus the Veientian war was
                    crushed by a fortunate act of temerity. </p>

                    corn having been brought in from Campania, and, as soon as the fear felt by each

                    licentious from their present abundance and ease, and their former subjects of
                    complaint, now that there were none abroad, they sought for at home; the
                    tribunes began to excite the commons by their poison, the agrarian law: they
                    roused them against the senators who opposed it, and not only against them as a
                    body, but also against particular individuals. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Q. Considius and T. Genucius, the proposers of the agrarian law, appoint a day
                    of trial for T. Menenius: the loss of the fort of Cremera, whilst the consul had
                    his standing camp at no great distance from thence, was the charge against him.
                        <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> They crushed him, though both the senators
                    had exerted themselves in his behalf with no less earnestness than in behalf of
                    Coriolanus, and the popularity of his father Agrippa was not yet forgotten.
                        <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> The tribunes, however, went no further
                    than a fine: though they had arraigned him for a capital offence, they imposed
                    on him, when found guilty, a fine of two thousand <hi rend="italics">asses.</hi>
                    This proved fatal. They say that he could not submit to the disgrace, and to the
                    anguish of mind (occasioned by it): that, in consequence, he was taken off by
                    disease. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> Another senator, Sp. Servilius, being
                    soon after arraigned, as soon as he went out of office, a day of trial having
                    been appointed for him by the tribunes, L. Caedicius and T. Statius, at the very
                    commencement of the year, in the consulship of C. Nautius and P. Valerius, did
                    not, like Menenius, meet the attacks of the tribunes with supplications from
                    himself and the patricians, but with firm reliance on his own integrity, and his
                    personal influence. <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> The battle With the
                    Etrurians at the Janiculum was the charge against him also: but being a man of
                    an intrepid spirit, as he had formerly acted in the case of public peril, so now
                    in that which was personal to himself, he dispelled the danger by boldly facing
                    it, by confuting not only the tribunes but the commons also, by a bold speech,
                    and upbraiding them with the condemnation and death of T. Menenius, by the good
                    offices of whose father the commons were formerly re-established, and were now
                    in possession of those laws and those magistrates, by' means of which they then
                    exercised their insolence; <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> his colleague <pb

                    witness, aided him by assigning to him a share of his own deserts; the
                    condemnation of Menenius however was of greater service to him (so much had they
                    changed their minds). </p>

                <p>
                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> The contests at home were now concluded. A
                    Veientian war broke out, with whom the Sabines had united their forces. The
                    consul P. Valerius, after auxiliaries were sent for from the Latins and
                    Hernicians, being despatched to Veii with an army, immediately attacks the
                    Sabine camp, which had been pitched before the walls of their allies: and
                    occasioned such great consternation, that while, dispersed in different
                    directions, they sally forth to repel the assault of the enemy, the gate which
                    the Romans first attacked was taken; then within the rampart there was rather a
                    carnage than a battle. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> From the camp the alarm
                    spreads into the city; the Veientians run to arms in as great a panic as if Veii
                    had been taken: some come up to the support of the Sabines, others fall upon the
                    Romans, who had directed all their force against the camp. <milestone n="3"
                        unit="section"/> For a little while they were disconcerted and thrown into
                    confusion; then they too forming two fronts make a stand: and the cavalry, being
                    commanded by the consul to charge, routs the Etrurians and puts them to flight;
                    and in the same hour two armies and two of the most influential and powerful of
                    the neighbouring states were vanquished. <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Whilst these transactions are going on at Veii, the Volsci and Aequi had pitched
                    their camp in the Latin territory, and laid waste their frontiers. The Latins,
                    by their own exertions, being joined by the Hernicians, without either a Roman
                    general or Roman auxiliaries, stripped them of their camp. <milestone n="5"
                        unit="section"/> Besides recovering their own effects, they obtained immense
                    booty. The consul C. Nautius, however, was sent against the Volsci from Rome.
                    The custom, I suppose, was not pleasing for allies to carry on wars with their
                    own forces and under their own direction without a Roman general and troops.
                        <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> There was no kind of injury or indignity
                    that was not practised against the Volsci; nor could they be prevailed on
                    however to come to an engagement in the field. </p>

                    consuls. The Veientians fell to Manlius as his province. War however did not

                    pay for the soldiers <pb n="145" xml:id="p.145"/> being demanded of them.
                        <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> Disturbance at home immediately succeeds
                    to peace abroad: the commons were, goaded by the tribunes with the excitement of
                    the agrarian law. The consuls, nothing intimidated by the condemnation of
                    Menenius, nor by the danger of Servilius, resist with their utmost might; Cn.
                    Genucius, a tribune of the people, arraigned the consuls on their going out of
                    office. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> Lucius Aemilius and Opiter Virginius
                    enter on the consulate. Instead of Virginius I find Vopiscus Julius consul in
                    some annals. In this year (whatever consuls it had) Furius and Manlius, being
                    summoned to trial before the people, go about in suppliant garb not more to the
                    commons than to the younger patricians; <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> they
                    advise, they caution them <quote> to keep themselves from honours and the
                        administration of public affairs, and that they would consider the consular
                        fasces, the praetexta and curule chair, as nothing else than the decorations
                        of a funeral; that when covered with these fine insignia, as with fillets,
                        they were doomed to death. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> But if the
                        charms of the consulate were so great, they should rest satisfied that the
                        consulate was held in captivity and crushed by the tribunitian power; that
                        every thing was to be done at the nod and command of the tribune by the
                        consul, as if he were a tribune's beadle. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                        If he stir, if he have reference to the patricians, if he should think for a

                        him place before his eyes the banishment of Caius Marcius, the condemnation
                        and death of Menenius. </quote>
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/> Fired by these discourses, the patricians from
                    that time held their consultations not in public, but in private, and withdrawn
                    from the knowledge of the many; where when this one point was agreed on, that
                    the accused must be rescued whether by just or unjust means, every proposition
                    that was most desperate was most approved; nor was an actor wanted for any deed
                    however daring. <milestone n="8" unit="section"/> Accordingly on the day of
                    trial, when the people stood in the forum in anxious expectation, they at first
                    began to feel surprised that the tribune did not come down; then when the delay
                    was now becoming more suspicious, they considered that he was deterred by the
                    nobles, and they complained that the public cause was abandoned and betrayed.

                    before the gate of the tribune's residence, bring word that he was found dead in

                    the whole assembly, just as an army disperses on the fall of its general, so did
                    they separate in different directions. The principal panic seized the tribunes,
                    now warned by their colleague's death what little aid the devoting laws afforded
                    them. <milestone n="10" unit="section"/> Nor did the patricians bear their joy
                    with sufficient moderation; and so far was any of them from feeling compunction
                    at the guilty act, that even those who were innocent wished to be considered to
                    have perpetrated it, and it was openly declared that the tribunitian power

                        <quote> there was an end of their liberty: that they were come back again to

                        Genucius and was buried with him; that other means must be devised and
                        practised, by which to resist the patricians; and that the only method for
                        that was that the people should defend themselves, since they now had no
                        other aid. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/> That four-and- twenty lictors
                        waited on the consuls; and that these very individuals were from among the
                        commons; that nothing could be more despicable, nor weaker, if there were
                        only persons who could despise them; that each person magnified those things
                        and made them objects of terror to himself. </quote>
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/> When they had excited each other by these

                    ought not to be made a common soldier. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> Volero
                    appeals to the tribunes. When one came to his assistance, the consuls order the
                    man to be stripped and the rods to be got ready. <quote>I appeal to the
                        people,</quote> says Volero, <quote> since tribunes had rather see a Roman

                    Then Volero, being both himself of great bodily strength, and being aided by his
                    partisans, having repulsed the lictor, when the shouts of those indignant in his

                    marched an army against the Aequans, when he could not entice the enemy to an
                    engagement, set about assaulting their camp. A violent storm sent down from
                    heaven with thunder and hail prevented him. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Then, on a signal for a retreat being given, their surprise was excited by the

                    thickly inhabited, the Sabines being aroused, after they met the depredators, on

                    of being resorted to, when it was ascertained from the burning of the

                    Numicius marched to Antium against the Volscians, Virginius against the Aequans.

                    The general conducted affairs better against the Volscians. The enemy were
                    routed in the first engagement, and forced to fly into the city of Antium,

                    Volscians engage the attention of the Roman armies, the Sabines advanced in
                    their devastations even to the gates of the city: then they themselves, a few
                    days after, received from the two armies heavier losses than they had

                    commons refused to attend the consular elections: Titus Quintius, Quintus
                    Servilius, were elected consuls by the patricians and their dependents: the

                    extensively, that he left nothing unmolested by war, and returned after
                    obtaining plunder much exceeding that carried off by the enemy. <milestone n="5"

                    First they fought a pitched battle, on equal ground, with great slaughter and
                    much bloodshed on both sides: <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> and the Romans,
                    because the fewness of their numbers was more likely to make the loss felt,
                    would have given way, had not the consul, by a well-timed fiction, re-animated
                    the army, crying out that the enemy were flying on the other wing; making a
                    charge, they, by supposing that they were victorious, became so. <milestone
                        n="7" unit="section"/> The consul, fearing lest by pressing too far he might
                    renew the contest, gave the signal for a retreat. <milestone n="8"
                        unit="section"/> A few days intervened; rest being taken on both sides as if
                    by a tacit suspension of arms; during these days a vast number of persons from
                    all the states of the Volscians and Aequans came to the camp, certain that the
                    Romans would depart during the night, if they should perceive them. <milestone
                        n="9" unit="section"/> Accordingly about the third watch they come to attack
                    the camp. Quintius having allayed the confusion which the sudden panic had
                    occasioned, after ordering the soldiers to remain quiet in their tents, leads
                    out a cohort of the Hernician for an advance guard: <milestone n="10"

                        <pb n="156" xml:id="p.156"/> in the camp, that the Romans had even the

                    infantry, whom they both considered to be more numerous than they were, and to
                    be Romans, the bustle and neighing of the horses, which became restless, both
                    from the strange riders placed on them, and moreover from the sound of the
                    trumpets frightening them, kept the Volscians intently awaiting an attack of the
                    enemy. </p>

                    <milestone n="1" unit="section"/> When day dawned, the Romans, invigorated and
                    refreshed with sleep, on being marched out to battle, at the first onset
                    overpowered the Volscians, wearied from standing and want of rest; though the
                    enemy rather retired than were routed, because in the rear there were hills to
                    which there was a secure retreat, the ranks behind the first line being
                    unbroken. <milestone n="2" unit="section"/> The consul, when they came to the
                    uneven ground, halts his army; the soldiers were kept back with difficulty; they
                    cried out and demanded to be allowed to pursue the enemy now discomfited. The
                    cavalry, crowding around the general, proceed more violently: they cry out that
                    they would proceed before the first line. <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Whilst the consul hesitates, relying on the valour of his men, yet having little
                    confidence in the place, they all cry out that they would proceed; and execution
                    followed the shout. Fixing their spears in the ground, in order that they may be
                    lighter to ascend the steeps, they run upwards. <milestone n="4" unit="section"
                    /> The Volscians, having discharged their missile weapons at the first onset,
                    fling the stones lying at their feet on them as they advanced upwards, and
                    having thrown them into confusion by incessant blows, they drove them from the
                    higher ground: thus the left wing of the Romans was nearly overborne, had not
                    the consul dispelled their fear by exciting a sense of shame as they were just
                    retreating, chiding at the same time their temerity and their cowardice. At
                    first they stood their ground with determined firmness; then, according as their
                    strength carried them against those in possession of the ground, they venture to
                    advance themselves; and by renewing the shout they encourage the whole body to
                    move on; then again making a new effort, they force their way up and surmount
                    the disadvantage of the ground. <milestone n="5" unit="section"/> They were on
                    the point of gaining the summit of the eminence, when the enemy turned their
                    backs, and the pursued and pursuers with precipitate speed rushed into the camp
                    almost in a body. <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> In this consternation the
