						            <p>Whether the task I have undertaken of writing a complete history of the
							Roman people from the very commencement of its existence will reward me
							for the labour spent on it, I neither know for certain, nor if I did
							know would I venture to say. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> For I see that this is an old-established and a common practice, each
							fresh writer being invariably persuaded that he will either attain
							greater certainty in the materials of his narrative, or surpass the
							rudeness of antiquity in the excellence of his style. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> However this may be, it will still be a great satisfaction to me to have
							taken my part, too, in investing, to the utmost of my abilities, the
							annals of the foremost nation in the world with a deeper interest; and
							if in such a crowd of writers my own reputation is thrown into the
							shade, I would console myself with the renown and greatness of those who
							eclipse my fame. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> The subject, moreover, is one that demands immense labour. It goes back
							beyond 700 years and, after starting from small and humble beginnings,
							has grown to such dimensions that it begins to be overburdened by its
							greatness. I have very little doubt, too, that for the majority of my
							readers the earliest times and those immediately succeeding, will
							possess little attraction; they will hurry on to these modern days in
							which the might of a long paramount nation is wasting by internal decay.
						</p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> I, on the other hand, shall look for a further reward of my labours in
							being able to close my eyes to the evils which our generation has
							witnessed for so many years; so long, at least, as I am devoting all my
							thoughts to retracing those pristine records, free from all the anxiety
							which can disturb the historian of his own times even if it cannot warp
							him from the truth. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p>The traditions of what happened prior to the foundation of the City or
							whilst it was being built, are more fitted to adorn the creations of the
							poet than the authentic records of the historian, and I have no
							intention of establishing either their truth or their falsehood. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> This much licence is conceded to the ancients, that by intermingling
							human actions with divine they may confer a more august dignity on the
							origins of states. Now, if any nation ought to be allowed to claim a
							sacred origin and point back to a divine paternity that nation is Rome.

						            <p> For such is her renown in war that when she chooses to represent Mars as
							her own and her founder's father, the nations of the world accept the
							statement with the same equanimity with which they accept her dominion.
						</p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> But whatever opinions may be formed or criticisms passed upon these and
							similar traditions, I regard them as of small importance. The subjects
							to which I would ask each of my readers to devote his earnest attention
							are these-the life and morals of the community; the men and the
							qualities by which through domestic policy and foreign war dominion was
							won and extended. Then as the standard of morality gradually lowers, let
							him follow the decay of the national character, observing how at first
							it slowly sinks, then slips downward more and more rapidly, and finally
							begins to plunge into headlong ruin, until he reaches these days, in
							which we can bear neither our diseases nor their remedies. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p>There is this exceptionally beneficial and fruitful advantage to be
							derived from the study of the past, that you see, set in the clear light
							of historical truth, examples of every possible type. From these you may
							select for yourself and your country what to imitate, and also what, as
							being mischievous in its inception and disastrous in its issues, you are
							to avoid. </p>

					          <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> Unless, however, I am misled by affection for my undertaking, there has
							never existed any commonwealth greater in power, with a purer morality,
							or more fertile in good examples; or any state in which avarice and
							luxury have been so late in making their inroads, or poverty and
							frugality so highly and continuously honoured, showing so clearly that
							the less wealth men possessed the less they coveted. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="12" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> In these latter years wealth has brought avarice in its train, and the
							unlimited command of pleasure has created in men a passion for ruining
							themselves and everything else through self-indulgence and
							licentiousness. But criticisms which will be unwelcome, even when
							perhaps necessary, must not appear in the commencement at all events of
							this extensive work. </p>

						            <p> We should much prefer to start with favourable omens, and if we could
							have adopted the poets' custom, it would have been much pleasanter to
							commence with prayers and supplications to gods and goddesses that they
							would grant a favourable and successful issue to the great task before
							us. </p>

							were massacred, against two of them —Aeneas and Antenor —the Achivi
							refused to exercise the rights of war, partly owing to old ties of

							making peace and surrendering Helen. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> Their subsequent fortunes were different. Antenor sailed into the
							furthest part of the Adriatic, accompanied by a number of Enetians who
							had been driven from <placeName key="tgn,7016760">Paphlagonia</placeName> by a revolution and after losing their king
							Pylaemenes before Troy were looking for a settlement and a leader. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> The combined force of Enetians and Trojans defeated the Euganei, who
							dwelt between the sea and the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> and occupied their land. The place where they
							disembarked was called <placeName key="tgn,7014164">Troy</placeName>,
							and the name was extended to the surrounding district; the whole nation
							were called Veneti. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> Similar misfortunes led to Aeneas becoming a wanderer but the Fates were
							preparing a higher destiny for him. He first visited <placeName key="tgn,7006667">Macedonia</placeName>, then was carried down to
								<placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> in quest of a
							settlement; from <placeName key="tgn,7003122">Sicily</placeName> he
							directed his course to the Laurentian territory. </p>

					          <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> Here, too, the name of <placeName key="perseus,Troy">Troy</placeName> is
							found, and here the Trojans disembarked, and as their almost infinite
							wanderings had left them nothing but their arms and their ships, they
							began to plunder the neighbourhood. The Aborigines, who occupied the
							country, with their king Latinus at their head came hastily together
							from the city and the country districts to repel the inroads of the
							strangers by force of arms. From this point there is a twofold
							tradition. According to the one, Latinus was defeated in battle, and
							made peace with Aeneas, and subsequently a family alliance. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="6" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> According to the other, whilst the two armies were standing ready to
							engage and waiting for the signal, Latinus advanced in front of his
							lines and invited the leader of the strangers to a conference. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> He inquired of him what manner of men they were, whence they came, what

							when they landed in Latinus' territory. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> When he heard that the men were Trojans, that their leader was Aeneas,
							the son of Anchises and Venus, that their city had been burnt, and that
							the homeless exiles were now looking for a place to settle in and build
							a city, he was so struck with the noble bearing of the men and their
							leader, and their readiness to accept alike either peace or war, that he
							gave his right hand as a solemn pledge of friendship for the future.
						</p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> A formal treaty was made between the leaders and mutual greetings
							exchanged between the armies. Latinus received Aeneas as a guest in his
							house, and there, in the presence of his tutelary deities, completed the
							political alliance by a domestic one, and gave his daughter in marriage
							to Aeneas. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="10" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> This incident confirmed the Trojans in the hope that they had reached

					          <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> They built a town, which Aeneas called <placeName key="perseus,Lavinium">Lavinium</placeName> after his wife. In a short time a boy was born

						            <p>In a short time the Aborigines and Trojans became involved in war with
							Turnus, the king of the Rutulians. Lavinia had been betrothed to him
							before the arrival of Aeneas, and, furious at finding a stranger
							preferred to him, he declared war against both Latinus and Aeneas. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="2" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> Neither side could congratulate themselves on the result of the battle;

					          <div n="3" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> Feeling their need of allies, Turnus and the Rutulians had recourse to
							the celebrated power of the Etruscans and Mezentius, their king, who was
							reigning at <placeName key="perseus,Caere">Caere</placeName>, a wealthy
							city in those days. From the first he had felt anything but pleasure at
							the rise of the new city, and now he regarded the growth of the Trojan

							proposal to join forces with the Rutulians. </p>

					          <div n="4" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> To keep the Aborigines from abandoning him in the face of this strong

							of Latins. </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="5" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> From that time the Aborigines were not behind the Trojans in their loyal
							devotion to Aeneas. So great was the power of Etruria that the renown of
							her people had filled not only the inland parts of <placeName key="tgn,1000080">Italy</placeName> but also the coastal districts
							along the whole length of the land from the <placeName key="tgn,2066659">Alps</placeName> to the Straits of <placeName key="tgn,7003897">Messina</placeName>. Aeneas, however, trusting to the loyalty of
							the two nations who were day by day growing into one, led his forces
							into the field, instead of awaiting the enemy behind his walls. </p>

							life to which he was condemned and the boorish bringing up amongst
							cattle to which he had to submit. The youth himself was the last to be
							exasperated by these accusations brought against his father. On the

							inside the gates proceeded straight to the house of M. Pomponius. He
							informed the porter that it was necessary for him to see his master at

							to plunge it into him at once unless he took the oath which he was going
							to dictate to him, “That he would never hold an Assembly of the
							plebs for the prosecution of his father.” The tribune was
							terrified, for he saw the steel glittering before his eyes, while he was
							alone and defenceless, in the presence of a youth of exceptional

							both in population and in military power, the Samnites defeated, the

							are quite able to assert the independence of Latium by force of arms.
							One consul must be elected from Rome, the other from Latium; the senate

							should fulfill his destiny. When the answers of the soothsayers, after
							they had inspected the victims, proved to correspond with their own

								account of an execution given by Plutarch: “The Vestal
								convicted of incest is buried alive in the neighbourhood of the

								small in size, with an opening in the vault through which the ladder
								is lowered; it is furnished with a bed, and oil lamp, and a few
								scanty provisions, such as bread, water, milk, and oil. These
								provisions (in fact a refinement of cruelty) are prepared because it
								would appear a sacrilege to condemn to starvation women formerly
								consecrated to the gods. The unfortunate culprit is brought here in
								a covered hearse, to which she is tied with leather straps, so that
								it is impossible that her sighs and lamentations should be heard by
								the attendant mourners. The crowd opens silently for the passage of
								the hearse; not a word is pronounced, not a murmur is heard. Tears
								stream from the eyes of every spectator. It is impossible to imagine
								a more horrible sight; the whole city is shaken with terror and
								sorrow. The hearse being brought to the edge of the opening, the
								executor cuts the bands and the high priest mutters an inaudible
								prayer, and lifts up his hands towards the gods, before bidding the
								culprit good-bye. He follows and assists her to the top of the
								ladder, and turns back at the fatal instant of her disappearance. As
								soon as she reaches the bottom, the ladder is removed, the opening
								is sealed, and a large mass of earth is heaped upon the stone that

							triumph. Vitrubius was to be kept in prison until the consul returned

							be razed and his goods devoted to Semo Sancus. The money realised by
							their sale was melted down into brazen orbs which were deposited in the

							revolt from Rome should be deported beyond the Tiber on the same
							conditions as those of Velitrae. After his triumph, when Vitrubius and
							his accomplices had been put to death, the consul thought that as the
							senate was satisfied with the punishment of the guilty, he might safely
							refer to the matter of the Privernates. He addressed the House in the
							following terms: </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="7" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> “Since the authors of the revolt, senators, have been visited by
							the immortal gods and by you with the punishment they deserved, what is
							your pleasure with regard to the innocent population? Although it is my
							duty to ask for opinions rather than to give them, I should like to say
							that in view of the fact that the Privernates are neighbours of the
							Samnites, with whom peaceful relations are now upon a most uncertain
							footing, I am anxious that as few grounds of complaint as possible

					          </div>
					          <div n="8" subtype="section" type="textpart">

							harsh, others a gentler course. The general divergence of opinion was
							widened by one of the Privernate envoys who was thinking more of the
							state of things in which he had been born than of his present plight.
							One of the senators who was advocating sterner measures asked him what
							punishment he thought </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="9" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> his countrymen deserved. He replied: “The punishment which those
							deserve who assert their liberty.” The consul saw that this

							spare you now, what sort of a peace may we hope to have with you for the
							time to come?” “A real and lasting one,” was the
							reply, “if its terms be good, but if they are bad, one that will
							soon be broken.” On hearing this, some of the senators exclaimed
							that he was using open threats, and that it was by such language that
							even those states which had been pacified were incited </p>
					          </div>
					          <div n="11" subtype="section" type="textpart">
						            <p> to renew hostilities. The better part of the senate, however, put a more

							asked, to be supposed that any people or, for that matter, any
							individual would remain longer than he could help under conditions which

							was brought to adopt this view mainly by the consul himself who kept
							repeating to the consulars —the men who had to state their opinions
							first —in a tone loud enough for many to hear, “Men whose first
							and last thought is their liberty deserve to become Romans.” Thus
							they gained their cause in the senate, and the proposal to confer full
