                            importuned me with the request that I should at length take steps to
                            publish the book on the Education of an Orator which I dedicated to my
                            friend Marcellus. For my own view was that it was not yet ripe for
                            publication. As you know I have spent little more than two years on its
                            composition, during which time moreover I have been distracted by a
                            multitude of other affairs. These two years have been devoted not so
                            much to actual writing as to the research demanded by a task to which
                            practically no limits can be set and to the reading of innumerable
                            authors. </p>

                        <p> Having at length, after twenty years devoted to the training of the
                            young, obtained leisure for study, I was asked by certain of my friends
                            to write something on the art of speaking. For a long time I resisted
                            their entreaties, since I was well aware that some of the most
                            distinguished Greek and Roman writers had bequeathed to posterity a
                            number of works dealing with this subject, to the composition of which
                            they had devoted the utmost care. </p>

                    <div n="2" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> This seemed to me to be an admirable excuse for my refusal, but served
                            merely to increase their enthusiasm. They urged that previous writers on
                            the subject had expressed different and at times contradictory opinions,
                            between which it was very difficult to choose. They thought therefore
                            that they were justified in imposing on me the task, if not of
                            discovering original views, at least of passing definite judgment on
                            those expressed by my predecessors. </p>

                        <p> I was moved to comply not so much because I felt confidence that I was
                            equal to the task, as <pb n="v1-3 p.7"/> because I had a certain
                            compunction about refusing. The subject proved more extensive than I had
                            first imagined; but finally I volunteered to shoulder a task which was
                            on a far larger scale than that which I was originally asked to
                            undertake. I wished on the one hand to oblige my very good friends
                            beyond their requests, and on the other to avoid the beaten track and
                            the necessity of treading where others had gone before. </p>

                        <p> For almost all others who have written on the art of oratory have
                            started with the assumption that their readers were perfect in all other
                            branches of education and that their own task was merely to put the
                            finishing touches to their rhetorical training; this is due to the fact
                            that they either despised the preliminary stages of education or thought
                            that they were not their concern, since the duties of the different
                            branches of education are distinct one from another, or else, and this
                            is nearer the truth, because they had no hope of making a remunerative
                            display of their talent in dealing with subjects, which, although
                            necessary, are far from being showy: just as in architecture it is the
                            superstructure and not the foundations which attracts the eye. </p>

                        <p> I on the other hand hold that the art of oratory includes all that is
                            essential for the training of an orator, and that it is impossible to
                            reach the summit in any subject unless we have first passed through all
                            the elementary stages. I shall not therefore refuse to stoop to the
                            consideration of those minor details, neglect of which may result in
                            there being no opportunity for more important things, and propose to
                            mould the studies of my orator from infancy, on the assumption that his
                            whole education has been entrusted to my charge. </p>

                            have been the truest of friends to me and you have shown a passionate
                            enthusiasm for literature. But good as these reasons are, they are not
                            the only reasons that lead me to regard you as especially worthy of such
                            a pledge of our mutual affection. There is also the consideration that
                            this book should prove of service in the education of your son Geta,
                            who, young though he is, already shows clear promise of real talent. It
                            has been my design to lead my reader from the very cradle of speech
                            through all the stages of education which can be of any service to our
                            budding orator till we have reached the very summit of the art. </p>

                        <p> I have been all the more desirous of so doing because two books on the
                            art of rhetoric are at present circulating under my name, although never
                            published by me or composed for such a purpose. One is a two days'
                            lecture which was taken down by the boys who were my audience. The other
                            consists of such notes as my good pupils succeeded in taking down from a
                            course of lectures on a somewhat more extensive scale: I appreciate
                            their kindness, but they showed an excess of enthusiasm and a certain
                            lack of discretion in doing my utterances the honour of publication.

                            theme will be treated with greater system and with as great perfection

                            essential for such an one is that he should be a good man, and
                            consequently we demand of him not merely the possession of exceptional
                                <pb n="v1-3 p.11"/> gifts of speech, but of all the excellences of

                            philosophy. The man who can really play his part as a citizen and is
                            capable of meeting the demands both of public and private business, the
                            man who can guide a state by his counsels, give it a firm basis by his
                            legislation and purge its vices by his decisions as a judge, is

                            speak in stammering accents and was puzzled by the shapes of letters.
                            Nor does the fact that capacity for learning is inadequate, prove that

                            the place to discuss the question as to whether it is better to have him

                            most famous states. It would, however, be folly to shut our eyes to the
                            fact that there are some who disagree with this preference for public
                            education owing to a certain prejudice in favour of private tuition.
                            These persons seem to be guided in the main by two principles. In the
                            interests of morality they would avoid the society of a number of human
                                <pb n="v1-3 p.41"/> beings at an age that is specially liable to
                            acquire serious faults: I only wish I could deny the truth of the view
                            that such education has often been the cause of the most discreditable
                            actions. Secondly they hold that whoever is to be the boy's teacher, he
                            will devote his time more generously to one pupil than if he has to
                            divide it among several. </p>

                            morality, I should give my vote for virtuous living in preference to
                            even supreme excellence of speaking. But in my opinion the two are
                            inseparable. I hold that no one can be a true orator unless he is also a
                            good man and, even if he could be, I would not have it so. I will
                            therefore deal with this point first. It is held that schools corrupt
                            the morals. </p>

                            of the preservation of a good reputation under either circumstance. The
                            nature of the individual boy and the care devoted to his education make
                            all the difference. Given a natural bent toward evil or negligence in
                            developing and watching over modest behaviour in early years, privacy
                            will provide equal opportunity for sin. The teacher employed at home may
                            be of bad character, and there is just as much danger in associating
                            with bad slaves as there is with immodest companions of good birth. </p>

                            will be neglected. But a good teacher will not burden himself with a
                            larger number of pupils than he can manage, and it is further of the
                            very first importance that he should be on friendly and intimate terms

                            criticism so far that they were not content with obelising lines or
                            rejecting books whose titles they regarded as spurious, as though they
                            were expelling a supposititious child from the family circle, but also
                            drew up a canon of authors, from which some were omitted altogether.

                        <p> Nor is it sufficient to have read the poets only; every kind of writer
                            must be carefully studied, not merely for the subject matter, but for
                            the vocabulary; for words often acquire authority from their use by a
                            particular author. Nor can such training be regarded as complete if it
                            stop short of music, for the teacher of literature has to speak of metre
                            and rhythm: nor again if he be ignorant of astronomy, can he understand
                            the poets; for they, to mention no further points, frequently give their
                            indications of time by reference to the rising and setting of the stars.
                            Ignorance of philosophy is an equal drawback, since there are numerous
                            passages in almost every poem based on the most intricate questions of
                            natural philosophy, while among the Greeks we have Empedocles and among
                            our own poets Varro and Lucretius, all of <pb n="v1-3 p.65"/> whom have

                            teaching of literature, the superstructure will collapse. The study of
                            literature is a necessity for boys and the delight of old age, the sweet
                            companion of our privacy and the sole branch of study which has more

                            into semivowels and mutes. But as the pupil gradually approaches the

                        <p> This, however, occurs far more frequently in Greek words such as <hi rend="italic">Atrei,</hi> which in our young days was pronounced by
                            the most learned of our elders with an acute accent on the first
                            syllable, necessitating a grave accent on the second; the same remark
                            applies to <hi rend="italic">Nerei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terei.</hi> Such has been the tradition as regards accents. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The Roman accent was a stress,
                                while the Greek was a pitch accent, though by the Christian era
                                tending to change into stress. Roman grammarians borrow the Greek
                                terminology and speak of accents in terms of pitch. The explanation
                                of this is probably that the Roman stress accent was accompanied by
                                an elevation of the pitch. Here the acute accent certainly implies
                                stress; the grave implies a drop in pitch and the absence of stress.
                                The circumflex means that the voice rises slightly and then falls
                                slightly, but implies stress. See Lindsay, <hi rend="italic">Latin

                            have no Latin equivalent. Similiarly they at tines borrow words from us.
                            In this connexion the problem arises whether foreign words should be

                            necessary, since the same letter involves a different meaning according
                            as it is long or short. For example we determine whether <hi rend="italic">mains</hi> is to mean an <quote>apple tree</quote> or
                            a <quote>bad man</quote> by the use of the circumflex; </p>

                            same letter is short in the nominative and long in the ablative, we
                            generally require the circumflex to make it clear which quantity to

                            For example since the latter part of <hi rend="italic">haruspex</hi> is

                            was sometimes used to express the syllable <pb n="v1-3 p.139"/> which is

                            with all these methods of expression which are concerned firstly with
                            gesture, secondly with the arrangement of words and thirdly with the

                            citing the example of Gaius Gracchus, the leading orator of his age, who
                            during his speeches had a musician standing behind him with a pitchpipe,
                            or <hi rend="italic">tonarion</hi> as the Greeks call it, whose duty it

                            than I have been in stating that the music which I desire to see taught
                            is not our modern music, which has been emasculated by the lascivious

                            family, calmed them by ordering the piper to change her strain to a
                            spondaic measure, while Chrysippus selects a special tune to be used by

                            which it is supposed that a piper is accused of manslaughter because he

                            quickness of perception. But it is considered that the value of geometry
                            resides in the process of learning, and not as with other sciences in

                            devoted special attention to this science. Geometry has two divisions;
                            one is concerned with numbers, the other with figures. Now knowledge of
                            the former is a necessity not merely to the orator, but to any one who
                            has had even an elementary education. Such knowledge is frequently
                            required in actual cases, in which a speaker is regarded as deficient in
                            education, I will not say if he hesitates in making a calculation, but
                            even if he contradicts the calculation which he states in words by

                            geometry. And is it not equally a necessity for oratory? Geometry
                            arrives at its conclusions from definite premises, and by arguing from
                            what is certain proves what was previously uncertain. Is not this just
                            what we do in speaking? Again are not the problems of geometry almost
                            entirely solved by the <pb n="v1-3 p.179"/> syllogistic method, a fact
                            which makes the majority assert that geometry bears a closer resemblance
                            to logic than to rhetoric? But even the orator will sometimes, though

                            anyone who does not know that the Roman acre is 240 feet long and 120
                            feet broad, and its total perimeter and the area enclosed can easily be

                        <p> But a square of 180 feet gives the same perimeter, yet contains a much
                            larger area within its four sides. If the calculation prove irksome to
                            any of my readers, he can learn the same truth by employing smaller

                            who have acquired sufficient knowledge to be able to teach rhetoric as
                            well; but when they do so, they are performing the duties of the

                        <p> A further point into which we must enquire concerns the age at which a
                            boy may be considered sufficiently advanced to profit by the
                            instructions of the rhetorician. In this connexion we must consider not
                            the boy's actual age, but the progress he has made in his studies. To
                            put it briefly, I hold that the best answer to the question <quote>When
                                should a boy be sent to the school of rhetoric?</quote>

                            dependent on that previously raised. For if the duties of the teacher of
                            literature are prolonged to include instruction in deliberative
                            declamation, this will <pb n="v1-3 p.209"/> postpone the need for the
                            rhetorician. On the other hand if the rhetorician does not refuse to
                            undertake the first duties of his task, his instruction will be required
                            from the moment the boy begins to compose narratives and his first
                            attempts at passages of praise or denunciation. </p>

                            briefly. For I do not think it necessary even to warn the teacher that
                            both he and his school must be free from the grosser vices. And should
                            there be any father who does not trouble to choose a teacher for his son
                            who is free from the obvious taint of immorality, he may rest assured
                            that all the other precepts, which I am attempting to lay down for the
                            benefit of our youth, will be absolutely useless to him, if he neglects

                            regard boys as ripe for the rhetorician, still do not think that they
                            should at once be placed under the most eminent teacher available, but
                            prefer to keep them for a while under inferior masters, on the ground
                            that in the elementary stages a mediocre instructor is easier to
                            understand and to imitate, and less reluctant to undertake the tiresome
                            task of teaching the rudiments as being beneath his notice. </p>

                            better it is to absorb the best possible principles, or how hard it is
                            to get rid of faults which have once become engrained; for it places a
                            double burden on the shoulders of the later teacher and the preliminary
                            task of unteaching is harder than that of teaching. </p>

                        <p> It is for this reason that the famous piper Timotheus is said to have

                            double the amount which he charged for those who came to him untaught.
                            The mistake to which I am referring is, however, twofold. First they
                            regard these inferior teachers as adequate for the time being and are
                            content with their instruction because they have a stomach that will

                            and not inferior in quality as well. Secondly, and this is a still
                            commoner delusion, they think that those who are blest with greater
                            gifts of speaking will not condescend to the more elementary details,
                            and that consequently they sometimes disdain to give attention to such

                            this eloquent teacher whom they fling in my face must be a sensible man

                            commencement of their studies, when progress is as yet but in the bud,
                            are more disposed to imitate their schoolfellows than their masters,
                            since such imitation comes more easily to them. Some of my readers may
                            think that the view which I am now maintaining is inconsistent with my

                            since pupils of a first rate master, having received a better training,
                            will when they speak say something that may be worthy of imitation,
                            while if they commit some mistake, they will be promptly corrected. But
                            the incompetent teacher on the other hand is quite likely to give his
                            approval to faulty work and by the judgment which he expresses to force

                            narrow sense in which that term is popularly used. For in my opinion it
                            is most desirable that we should commence with something resembling the

                        <p> Now there are three forms of narrative, without counting the type used
                            in actual legal cases. First there is the fictitious narrative as we get
                            it in tragedies and poems, which is not merely not true but has little
                            resemblance to truth. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> With
                                special reference to the element of the miraculous. Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> would give a good example.
                            </note> Secondly, there is the realistic narrative as presented by
                            comedies, which, though not true, has yet a certain verisimilitude.
                            Thirdly there is the historical narrative, which is an exposition of
                            actual fact. Poetic narratives are the property of the teacher of
                            literature. The rhetorician therefore should begin with the historical
                            narrative, whose force is in proportion to its truth. </p>

                            sufficiently expressive?); nor on the other hand must it be tortuous or
                            revel in elaborate descriptions, such as those in which so many are led

                            should almost be equal to the most serious tasks of rhetoric. The answer
                            to the question as to whether this exercise is more nearly related to
                            deliberative or controversial oratory depends on custom and law and
                            consequently varies in different states. Among the Greeks the proposer
                            of a law was called upon to set forth his case before a judge, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                                assembly, who examined the provisions of the proposed law. </note>
                            while in Rome it was the custom to urge the acceptance or rejection of a
                            law before the public assembly. But in any case the arguments advanced
                            in such cases are few in number and of a definite type. For there are
                            only three kinds of law, <hi rend="italic">sacred, public</hi> and <hi rend="italic">private.</hi>

                            appointment as tribune of the plebs was alleged to be unconstitutional.

                            law is concerned, as to whether they <pb n="v1-3 p.245"/> deserve
                            punishment or reward or as to the degree of punishment or reward that
                            should be assigned, since excess in either direction is open to

                            the pupils whom he has undertaken to train, instruction in the reading
                            of history and still more of the orators. I myself have adopted this
                            practice for the benefit of a few pupils of suitable age whose parents

                            easier to understand. Others on the contrary would select the more
                            florid school of writers on the ground that they are likely to provide

                            simplest and most intelligible. For instance, when prescribing for boys,
                            I should give Livy the preference over Sallust; for, although the latter
                            is the greater historian, one requires to be well-advanced in one's

                            from him, but to come to love him. After Cicero I should, following the
                            advice of Livy, place such authors as most nearly resemble him. </p>

                            admiration of antiquity, should be allowed to cramp their minds by the
                            study of Cato and the Gracchi and other similar authors. For such
                            reading will give them a harsh and bloodless style, since they will as
                            yet be unable to understand the force and vigour of these authors, and
                            contenting themselves with a style which doubtless was admirable in its
                            day, but is quite unsuitable to ours, will come to think (and <pb n="v1-3 p.257"/> nothing could be more fatal) that they really

                            blooms produced by our modern euphuists, thus acquiring a passion for
                            the luscious sweetness of such authors, whose charm is all the more
                            attractive to boyish intellects because it is so easy of achievement.

                            after clearing away all the uncouthness of those rude ages, we succeed
                            in absorbing the robust vigour and virility of their native genius, our
                            more finished style will shine with an added grace: I also approve the
                            study of the moderns at this stage, since even they have many merits.

                            superiors. It will therefore be possible to select much that is valuable
                            from modern writers, but we must take care that the precious metal is
                            not debased by the dross with which it is so closely intermingled. </p>

                            differed. Some have not been content with giving directions as to the
                            arrangement of the subjects set them as themes for declamation, but have
                            developed them at some length themselves, supplying not merely the
                            proofs, but the lines upon which the emotional passages should proceed.

                        <p> Others have merely suggested a bare outline, and then when the
                            declamations were over, have indicated the points missed by each speaker
                            and worked up certain passages with no less care than they would have

                            more profitable to point out the right road at the outset, and not
                            merely to recall the pupil from his error when he has already gone

                            declamation, he has to take them down and think about them: secondly
                            instruction is always more readily received than reproof. Indeed those

                        <p> There is one practice at present in vogue for boys of the age under
                            discussion, which ought in my opinion undoubtedly to be changed. They
                            should not be forced to commit all their own compositions to memory and
                            to deliver them on an appointed day, as is at present the custom. This
                            practice is especially popular with the boys' fathers, who think that
                            their sons are not really studying unless they declaim on every possible
                            occasion, although as a matter of fact progress depends <pb n="v1-3 p.263"/> mainly on industry. </p>

                            have them spend as much time as possible over such tasks, I had much
                            rather that for the purpose of learning by heart passages should be
                            selected from the orators or historians or any other works that may be

                            compositions with which they are already familiar. Further they will
                            form an intimate acquaintance with the best writings, will carry their
                            models with them and unconsciously reproduce the style of the speech

                            treasure-house, if I may so call it, in which they are stored. In
                            addition they will be in the agreeable position of being able to quote
                            the happy sayings of the various authors, a power which they will find
                            most useful in the courts. For phrases which have not been coined merely

                            applause of a large audience, that most coveted of all prizes. But this

                            speaking well. The artist is he who has acquired the art, that is to

                            achievement of the artist, namely good speaking. Each of these three <hi rend="italic">general</hi> divisions is in its turn divided into <hi rend="italic">species.</hi> Of the two latter divisions I shall

                            first and chief disagreement on the subject is found in the fact that
                            some think that even bad men may be called orators, while others, of
                            whom I am one, restrict the name of orator and the art itself to those

                            their theme is the art of rhetoric, while Cicero <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            consider that rhetoric, which, as I have already said, is the noblest

                            wits by the selection of a difficult theme, like Polycrates, when he
                            praised Busiris and Clytemnestra; I may add that he is credited with a
                            not dissimilar performance, namely the composition of a speech which was

                            defended on the ground that uneducated persons, barbarians and slaves,

                            teaching of rhetoric as an art was, they say, a later invention dating

                            experiment: wounds were bound up long before medicine developed into an

                            These critics also charge rhetoric with doing what no art does, namely
                            making use of vices to serve its ends, since it speaks the thing that is

                            does contradict itself; no art tries to demolish what itself has built,
                            but this does happen in the operations of rhetoric; or again:— rhetoric
                            teaches either what ought to be said or what ought not to be said;
                            consequently it is not an art because it teaches what ought not to be
                            said, or because, while it teaches what ought to be said, it also
                            teaches precisely the opposite. </p>

                            place therein and consequently it can scarcely happen even under the
                            most exceptional circumstances that an orator, that is to say, a good

                            not undo its own work. For the orator does not refute his own arguments,
                            nor does rhetoric even do so, because those who regard persuasion as its

                            at stating what is probable? The answer is that the orator knows that
                            what he states is no more than probable. </p>

                            generally agreed, rhetoric must also be an art, since it differs from
                            logic in <hi rend="italic">species</hi> rather than in <hi rend="italic">genus.</hi> Nor must I omit to point out that where it is possible
                            in any given subject for one man to act without art and another with
                            art, there must necessarily be an art in connexion with that subject, as
                            there must also be in any subject in which the man who has received
                            instruction is the superior of him who has not. </p>

                            the trained speaker will get the better of the untrained. For even the
                            trained man will prove inferior to one who has received a better

                            us, since we concede the possession of oratory to none save the good

                            facts we must come to the conclusion that, in the main, rhetoric is
                            concerned with action; for in action it accomplishes that which it is

                            with the mere examination of a thing. Rhetoric is still in the orator's
                            possession even though he be silent, while if he gives up pleading
                            either designedly or owing to circumstances over which he has no
                            control, he does not therefore cease to be an orator, any more than a
                            doctor ceases to be a doctor when he withdraws from practice. </p>

                            say from toil, and can enjoy the pleasure of self-contemplation. </p>

                            art. Still, if rhetoric is to be regarded as one of these three classes
                            of art, since it is with action that its <pb n="v1-3 p.349"/> practice
                            is chiefly and most frequently concerned, let us call it an active or

                        <p> I quite realise that there is a further question as to whether eloquence
                            derives most from nature or from education. This question really lies
                            outside the scope of our inquiry, since the ideal orator must
                            necessarily be the result of a blend of both. But I do regard it as of
                            great importance that we should decide how far there is any real
                            question on this point. </p>

                        <p> For if we make an absolute divorce between the two, nature will still be
                            able to accomplish much without the aid of education, while the latter
                            is valueless without the aid of nature. If, on the other hand, they are
                            blended in equal proportions, I think we shall find that the average
                            orator owes most to nature, while the perfect orator owes more to
                            education. We may take a parallel from agriculture. A thoroughly barren
                            soil will not be improved even by the best cultivation, while good land
                            will yield some useful produce without any cultivation; but in the case
                            of really rich land cultivation will do more for it than its own natural
                            fertility. </p>

                            a block of Parian marble, its artistic value would owe more to his skill
                            than to the material. To conclude, nature is the raw material for
                            education: the one forms, the other is formed. Without material art can
                            do nothing, material without art does possess a certain value, while the

                            honourable and the reverse? How <pb n="v1-3 p.355"/> can he urge a

                            whose material is characterised by the same multiplicity: such for

                            that is a question for the qualified physician. Will he not deal with
                            measurements and figures? And yet we must admit that they form part of
                            mathematics. For my part I hold that practically all subjects are under
                            certain circumstances liable to come up for treatment by the orator. If
                            the circumstances do not occur, the subjects will not concern him. </p>

                            assertion which is confirmed by the practice of everyday speech. For
                            when we have been given a subject on which to speak, we often preface
                            our remarks by calling attention to the fact that the matter has been

                            asserted that the material of oratory lay in the cause and the questions
                            it involved, thereby including every subject that can be brought before

                            it produces nothing, but the artist must have them. The engraver cannot
                            work without his chisel nor the painter without his brush. I shall

                            that it was useful, that it was a virtue and that its material was all

                            Apollodorus himself seems to be that addressed to Matius, as his letter

                        <p> The question as to the origin of rhetoric need not keep us long. For who
                            can doubt that mankind received the gift of speech from nature at its
                            birth (for we can hardly go further back than that), while the
                            usefulness of speech brought improvement and study, and finally method

                            originated in the fact that <pb n="v1-3 p.383"/> those who were in peril
                            owing to some accusation being made against them, set themselves to
                            speak with studied care for the purpose of their own defence. This,
                            however, though a more honourable origin, cannot possibly be the
                            earlier, for accusation necessarily precedes defence. You might as well
                            assert that the sword was invented for the purpose of self-defence and

                            medicine by observing that some things were healthy and some the
                            reverse, so they observed that some things were useful and some useless

                            certain other precepts according as their nature suggested. These
                            observations were confirmed by experience and each man proceeded to

                            speeches require much more. For not only what we say and how we say it
                            is of importance, but also the circumstances under which we say it. It
                            is here that the need of arrangement comes in. But it will be impossible
                            to say everything demanded by the subject, putting each thing in its

                            department common to them all and acting as their guardian. Again in the

                            to persuade, while the power of persuasion resides in the art.
                            Consequently, while it is the duty of the orator to invent and arrange,

                            regard them merely as first-principles, like the moisture, fire, matter
                            or atoms of which the universe is said to be composed. Nor is it correct
                            to call them duties, since they are not preformed by others, but perform
                            something themselves. We must therefore conclude that they are <hi rend="italic">parts.</hi>

                            have been further influenced by the fact that they wished to reserve the

                            occurred to me that the tasks of oratory must either be concerned with

                            must instruct, move and charm his hearers. This is a clearer division
                            than that made by those who divide the task of oratory into that which
                            relates to things and that which concerns the emotions, <pb n="v1-3 p.399"/> since both of these will not always be present in
                            the subjects which we shall have to treat. For some themes are far from
                            calling for any appeal to the emotions, which, although room cannot
                            always be found for them, produce a most powerful effect wherever they

                            require proof and others which do not, a view with which I agree. Some
                            on the other hand, as for instance Celsus, think that the orator will
                            not speak on any subject unless there is some question involved in it;
                            but the majority of writers on rhetoric are against him, as is also the
                            threefold division of oratory, unless indeed to praise what is allowed
                            to be honourable and to denounce what is admittedly disgraceful are no
                            part of an orator's duty. </p>

                            question that the <hi rend="italic">definite</hi> is derived. I will
                            illustrate what I mean by an example. The question <quote>Should a man

                                <quote>Should Cato marry?</quote> is <hi rend="italic">definite,</hi> and consequently may be regarded as a subject for a

                            no connexion with particular persons are generally given a specific
                            reference. For instance the question <quote>Ought we to take a share in
                                the government of our country?</quote> is abstract, whereas
                                <quote>Ought we to take part in the government of our country under
                                the sway of a tyrant?</quote> has a specific reference. </p>

                            admission of time and quality; but all the same you would scarcely be
                            justified in calling it a cause or definite question. Those questions

                            that no money ever came into his client's hands. Still I should say that
                            the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> was to be found in the latter as being

                        <p> Again in the case of Milo I do not consider that the conflict is raised

                            powers to prove that Clodius lay in wait for Milo and was therefore
                            rightly killed. The point on which above all the orator must make up his
                            mind, even although he may be going to <pb n="v1-3 p.415"/> take up
                            various lines of argument in support of his case, is this: what is it
                            that he wishes most to impress upon the mind of the judge? But although
                            this should be the first point for his consideration, it does not follow
                            that it should be the first that he will make in his actual speech. </p>

                            first point raised by the other side in its defence. Cicero <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                                93. </note> expresses this view in the following words:— <quote> the
                                argument on which the defence first takes its stand with a view to
                                rebutting the charge. </quote> This involves a further question as
                            to whether the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> can only be determined by
                            the defence. Cornelius Celsus is strongly against this view, and asserts
                            that the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> is derived not from the denial of
                            the charge, but from him who affirms his proposition. Thus if the
                            accused denies that anyone has been killed, the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> will originate with the accuser, because it is the
                            latter who desires to prove: if on the other hand the accused asserts
                            that the homicide was justifiable, the burden of proof has been
                            transferred and the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> will proceed from the
                            accused and be affirmed by him. I do not, however, agree. </p>

                            useful at first to adopt a slightly less rigid method: the road will not
                            be absolutely straight to begin with, but it will be more open and will
                            provide easier going. I would have them therefore learn above all things
                                <pb n="v1-3 p.453"/> that there are four different methods which may

                            them as first essentials. For, to begin with the defendant, far the
                            strongest method of self-defence is, if possible, to deny the charge.
                            The second best is when it is possible to reply that the particular act
                            with which you are charged was never committed. The third and most
                            honourable is to maintain that the act was justifiable. If none of these
                            lines of defence are feasible, there remains the last and only hope of
                            safety: if it is impossible either to deny the charge or justify the
                            act, we must evade the charge with the aid of some point of law, making

                            custom. There are also certain things which although equitable are
                            prohibited by law; witness the restrictions placed on testamentary

                            been born? The second is concerned with the letter of the law and

                            son, but he will defend his claim by appealing to the intention of the
                            law, which he will maintain to imply that the bastard, born when there

                            But in this connexion each will rely on his own particular question. For
                            the disinherited son will say that even a disinherited man does not
                            cease <pb n="v1-3 p.463"/> to be a son, and will derive an argument from
                            that very law which denies his claim to the inheritance; namely that it
                            was unnecessary for a disinherited son to be excluded from possession of
                            his father's property if he had ceased to be one of the family; but now,
                            since in virtue of his rights as son he would have been his father's
                            heir if he had died intestate, the law is brought to bar his claim; and
                            yet the law does not deprive him of his position as son, but only of his
                            position as heir. Here the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> is <hi rend="italic">definitive,</hi> as turning on the definition of a

                            have stood the test of time. For some great men like Menander have
                            received ampler justice from the verdict of posterity than from that of

                            institutions on those that first introduced them; for instance Numa
                            first laid down rules for the worship of the gods, and Publicola first
                            ordered that the lictors' rods should be lowered in salutation to the

                            while in some cases distinction has merely served to increase the
                            notoriety and unpopularity of vices. In regard to some persons, as in

                            their natural advantages were nullified by their vices: the poets for

                            respect the laws. Frugality might perhaps be unpopular with the
                            Sybarites, whilst luxury was regarded as a crime by the ancient Romans.

                            Aristotle also urges a point, which at a later date Cornelius Celsus
                            emphasised almost to excess, to the effect that, since the boundary

                            words that swerve a little from the actual truth, calling a rash man
                            brave, a prodigal generous, a mean man thrifty; or the process may, if
                            necessary, be reversed. But this the ideal orator, that is to say a good

                            necessary for us to suffer something, but we are not compelled to do
                            anything; whereas the subject of deliberation is primarily whether we

                            worse things, the question will be one of expediency. For example, if a

                            Such topics arise from some contradiction; for example a thing is

                            thought that will immediately occur to my reader: <quote>Do you then
                                teach that this should be done or think it right?</quote> Cicero

                                wrong for me to urge Caesar to follow it, since it is contrary to

                            he writes to Brutus in the following terms, after setting forth a number
                            of things that <pb n="v1-3 p.501"/> might honourably be urged on Caesar:
                                <quote> Should I be a good man to advise this? No. For the end of
                                him who gives advice is the advantage of the man to whom he gives
                                it. But, you say, your advice is right. Certainly, but there is not
                                always room for what is right in giving advice. </quote> However,
                            this is a somewhat abstruse question, and does not concern deliberative

                            written. Do you suppose that Cicero thought in the same way or assumed

                            gave a voice so that though they spoke better than they could by nature,
                            they still might seem to speak in their own persons? </p>

                        <p> For a speech which is out of keeping with the man who delivers it is

                            should conform. It is for this reason that Lysias is regarded as having
                            shown the highest art in the speeches which he wrote for uneducated
                            persons, on account of their extraordinary realism. In the case of
                            declaimers indeed it is of the first importance that they should
                            consider what best suits each character: for they rarely play the role
                            of advocates in their declamations. As a rule they impersonate sons,
                            parents, rich men, old men, gentle or harsh of temper, misers,
                            superstitious persons, cowards and mockers, so that hardly even comic
                            actors have to assume more numerous roles in their performances on the

                            involves the assumption of a role. It is sometimes introduced even with
                            controversial themes, which are drawn from history and involve the

                            oratory, which presents the utmost variety, but whose duties are no more
                            than two, the bringing and rebutting of charges. Most authorities divide
                            the forensic speech into five parts: the <hi rend="italic">exordium,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">statement of facts,</hi> the
                                <hi rend="italic">proof,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">refutation,</hi>
                            and the <hi rend="italic">peroration.</hi> To these some have added the
                                <hi rend="italic">partition into heads, proposition</hi> and <hi rend="italic">digression,</hi> the two first of which form part of

                            Why then, if <hi rend="italic">proposition</hi> is a part of a speech,
                            should not <hi rend="italic">conclusion</hi> be also? <hi rend="italic">Partition</hi> on the other hand is merely one aspect of <hi rend="italic">arrangement,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">arrangement</hi> is a part of rhetoric itself, and is equally

                        <p> Further, if the judge is thought to have come into court with a
                            prejudice in favour of one side, we must try to remove or strengthen
                            that prejudice as circumstances may demand. Again occasionally we shall
                            have to calm the judges' fears, as Cicero does in the <hi rend="italic">pro Milone,</hi> where he strives to persuade them not to think

                            themselves. Or it may be necessary to frighten them, as Cicero does in

                        <p> There are two ways of bringing fear to bear upon the judges. The
                            commonest and most popular is to threaten them with the displeasure of
                            the Roman people or the transference of the juries to another class
                                <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                                their trial. If they fail in their duty, the constitution of the
                                panels will be altered and the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi> be
                                admitted as well. </note> ; the second is somewhat brutal and is
                            rarely employed, and consists in threatening them with a prosecution for
                            bribery: this is a method which is fairly safe with a large body of
                            judges, since it checks the bad and pleases the good members of the
                            jury, but I should never recommend its employment with a single judge
                                <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> It must be borne in mind
                                that <hi rend="italic">iudex</hi> may be a juryman forming one of a

                            realistically on the lines which would be followed in actual pleading.
                            But these peculiar circumstances arise from such a variety of causes as

                            are likely to be of service. If the case itself is weak, we may derive
                            help from the character of our client; if his character is doubtful, we
                            may find salvation in the nature of <pb n="v4-6 p.31"/> the case. If
                            both are hopeless, we must look out for something that will damage our
                            opponent. For though it is desirable to secure as much positive

                            advocate to put forward such pleas than for his client, since the former
                            can praise without laying himself open to the charge of arrogance and

                            erroneous. In the first place there are some cases which are so brief,
                            that they require only a brief summary rather than a full statement of

                            law, as it so often does in the centumviral court, as for example when
                            we discuss, whether the heir of a woman who has died intestate should be
                            her son or brother, or whether puberty is to be reckoned by age or by
                            physical development. The same situation arises also in cases where the
                            facts admit of full statement, but are well known to the judge or have
                            been correctly set forth by a previous speaker. </p>

                            for him to make a simple summary of his case or because it is more
                            expedient for him to do so. It may, for instance, suffice to say,

                                with sacrilege, since the money was not consecrated, but private
                                property: it is for you to decide whether under these circumstances

                            this Ulysses does not merely reply that he did not do the deed, but adds
                            that he had no quarrel with Ajax, the contest between them having been
                            concerned solely with the winning of renown: he then goes on to say how

                        <p> These three questions, then, served the purpose of an exordium, since
                            they all of them were designed to prepare the minds of the judges. Again
                            in the <hi rend="italic">pro Vareno</hi> Cicero delayed his statement of

                            prosecution. This may be done with advantage whenever we have not merely
                            to rebut the charge, but to turn the tables on our opponents: thus after
                            first rebutting the charge, we make <hi rend="italic">our statement of

                        <p> There will also not infrequently be certain cases, in which it is easy
                            to rebut the charge that is under trial, but the conduct of which is
                            hampered by the past life of our client and the many and serious crimes
                            which he has committed. We must dispose of these first, in order that
                            the judge may give a favourable hearing to our defence of the actual
                            facts which form the question at issue. For example, if we have to
                            defend Marcus Caelius, the best course for his advocate to adopt will be
                            to meet the imputations of luxury, wantonness and immorality which are
                            made against him before we proceed to the actual charge of poisoning. It
                            is with these points that the speech of Cicero in his defence is
                            entirely concerned. Is he then to go on to make a statement about the
                            property of Palla and explain the whole question of rioting, a charge
                            against which Caelius has already defended himself in the speech which

                            impossible to hit the happy mean. The followers of Theodorus on the
                            other hand recognise only plausibility on the ground that it is not
                            always expedient that our exposition should be either short or clear.

                            to be believed: we shall for instance represent a person accused of
                            theft as covetous, accused of adultery as lustful, accused of homicide
                            as rash, or attribute the opposite qualities to these persons if we are
                            defending them: further we must do the same with place, time and the

                            most effective stroke of all is his cunning feint of simplicity: <quote>
                                Milo, on the other hand, having been in the senate all day till the
                                house rose, went home, changed his shoes and clothes, and waited for
                                a short time, while his wife was getting ready, as is the way with

                            and a careful concealment of his art. Had he spoken otherwise, his words
                            would by their very sound have warned the judge to keep an eye on the

                            with loans, letting and hiring and interdicts? Nor yet is it always

                            Magnificence of diction is therefore no more specially appropriate to
                            the statement of facts than language calculated to excite pity or
                            hatred, or characterised by dignity, charm or wit. Each of these
                            qualities is admirable in its proper place, but none can be regarded as
                            the peculiar and inalienable property of this portion of the speech.

                            himself holds that more qualities are required. For in addition to

                            But before I enter on this portion, I have a few words to say on the
                            opinions held by certain rhetoricians. Most of them are in the habit, as
                            soon as they have completed the <hi rend="italic">statement of
                                facts,</hi> of digressing to some pleasant and attractive topic with
                            a view to securing the utmost amount of favour from their audience. </p>

                    <div n="2" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> This practice originated in the display of the schools of declaration
                            and thence extended to the courts as soon as causes came to be pleaded,
                            not for the benefit of the parties concerned, but to enable the
                            advocates to flaunt their talents. I imagine that they feared that if
                            the slender stream of concise statement, such as is generally required,
                            were followed by the pugnacious tone inevitable in the arguing of the
                            case, the speech would fall flat owing to the postponement of the
                            pleasures of a more expansive eloquence. </p>

                        <p> The objection to this practice lies in the fact that they do this
                            without the slightest consideration of the difference between case and
                            case or reflecting whether what they are doing will in any way assist
                            them, on the assumption that it is always expedient and always
                            necessary. Consequently they transfer striking thoughts from the places
                            which they should have occupied elsewhere and concentrate them in this
                            portion of the speech, a practice which involves either the repetition
                            of a number of things that they have already said or their omission from
                            the place which was really theirs owing to the fact that they have
                            already been said. </p>

                        <p> I admit however that this form of digression can be advantageously

                            but to each of the different questions or to the questions as a whole,

                            permit it. Indeed such a practice confers great distinction and
                            adornment on a speech, but only if the digression fits in well with the
                            rest of the speech and follows naturally on what has preceded, not if it
                            is thrust in like a wedge parting what should naturally come together.

                            room for digression; for example if the end of the <hi rend="italic">statement</hi> has been concerned with some specially horrible
                            theme, we may embroider the theme as though our indignation must find

                            heighten it, since the horrible nature of a charge is in favour of the
                            accused, until the charge is proved. For it is just the most flagrant

                            for his ingratitude, or after producing a variety of charges in your

                            proof and desires to satisfy himself of the correctness of his
                            impressions at the earliest possible moment. Further, care must be taken
                            not to nullify the effect of the <hi rend="italic">statement</hi> by <pb n="v4-6 p.127"/> diverting the minds of the court to some other

                            disposing him to lend a favouring ear to our proofs. Moreover we can do

                            view appeals to the emotions were to be excluded for two reasons, first
                            on the ground that all disturbance of the mind was a fault, and secondly
                            that it was wrong to distract the judge from the truth by exciting his
                            pity, bringing influence to bear, and the like. Further, to seek to
                            charm the audience, when the aim of the orator was merely to win
                            success, was in their opinion not only superfluous for a pleader, but

                            approval. It is to the effect that there are some proofs adopted by the
                            orator which lie outside the art of speaking, and others which he
                            himself deduces or, if I may use the term, begets out of his case. The
                            former therefore have been styled <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἄτεχνοι</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">inartificial</hi> proofs,

                        <p> As regards decisions in previous courts, these fall under three heads.
                            First, we have matters on which judgment has been given at some time or
                            other in cases of a similar nature: these are, however, more correctly
                            termed precedents, as for instance where a father's will has been
                            annulled or confirmed in opposition to his sons. Secondly, there are
                            judgments concerned with the case itself; it is from these that the name
                                <hi rend="italic">praeiudicium</hi> is derived: as examples I may
                            cite those passed against Oppianicus <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                           <hi rend="italic">pro Cluent.</hi> xvii. <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi>

                        </note> Thirdly, there are judgments passed on the actual
                            case, as for example in cases where the accused has been deported, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Banished persons who have been
                                accused afresh after their restoration. </note> or where renewed
                            application is made for the recognition of an individual as a free man,
                                <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> When a slave claimed his

                                The Latin suggests that portions of a case might be tried by two

                                the two panels sitting conjointly. The <hi rend="italic">hasta</hi>

                            two cases. As for their reversal, this can rarely be <pb n="v4-6 p.161"/> obtained by denouncing the judges, unless they have been guilty of
                            obvious error. For each of those who are trying the case wishes the
                            decision given by another to stand, since he too has to give judgment
                            and is reluctant to create a precedent that may recoil upon himself.

                            is impossible and the case is the same as that on which the previous

                            We must also ask the judges to consider the facts of the case on their
                            merits rather than make their verdict the inevitable consequence of a

                                into court. The matter of the oath rested with the profferer, and
                                the taking of such a proffered oath meant victory for the swearer.

                            such evidence are not really witnesses, but are merely reporting the
                            words of unsworn persons, while in cases of extortion, those who swear
                            that they paid certain sums to the accused are to be regarded not as

                            believing the witness or the reverse. And since there are two classes of

                            in court and must test them by a variety of questions such as may well
                            be put to them by his opponent. The result will be that they will not
                            contradict themselves or, if they do make some slip, can be set upon
                            their feet again by a timely question from the advocate who produces

                            at once proceed to question him on the point at issue. On the contrary

                            employment of commonplaces on similar lines, since the prosecutor, if he

                            which is apt to prove highly disconcerting to the examiner. </p>

                        <p> I must however express the strongest disapproval of the practice of
                            sending a suborned witness to sit on the benches of the opposing party,
                            in order that on being called into the witness-box from that quarter he
                            may thereby do all the more damage to the case for the accused by
                            speaking against the party with whose adherents he was sitting or, while
                            appearing to help him by his testimony, deliberately giving his evidence
                            in such an extravagant and exaggerated manner, as not only to detract
                            from the credibility of his own statements, but to annul the advantage
                            derived from the evidence of those who were really helpful. I mention
                            this practice not with a view to encourage it, but to secure its
                            avoidance. Documentary evidence is not frequently in conflict with oral.
                            Such a circumstance may be turned to advantage by either side. For one
                            party will rest its case on the fact that the witness is speaking on
                            oath, the other on the unanimity of the signatories. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> An over-statement, since in
                                many cases the signatories could only testify that the statement was
                                that actually made by the deponent; with its truth they were not
                                necessarily concerned. </note>

                        <p> Again there is often a conflict between the evidence and the arguments.
                            One party will argue that the witnesses know the facts and are bound by
                            the <pb n="v4-6 p.189"/> sanctity of their oath, while the arguments are
                            nought but ingenious juggling with the facts. The other party will argue
                            that witnesses are procured by influence, fear, money, anger, hatred,
                            friendship, or bribery, whereas arguments are drawn from nature; in

                            be the subject of vehement debate. Sometimes there are witnesses on both
                            sides and the question arises with regard to themselves as to which are
                            the more respectable in character, or with regard to the case, which
                            have given the more credible evidence, with regard to the parties to the

                            would remind him that there are two ways in which these may be treated.
                            There is the general method, with regard to which there is an endless
                            dispute between the adherents of the Stoics and the Epicureans, as to
                            whether the world is governed by providence. The other is special and is
                            concerned with particular departments of the art of divination,
                            according as they may happen to affect the question at issue. </p>

                            of establishing or demolishing such evidence as the following will give
                            the orator plenty to do; as for example if certain words have been

                            of children, whom the one party will assert to be incapable of
                            invention, while the other will assert that they do not know what they

                            who, avoiding arguments as rugged and repulsive things, confine

                            the nature of each of these passions. It is by these same methods that

                            with things or persons, nor can there be any ground for argument save in

                            the case itself, when anything is discovered in it which cannot be

                        <p> Every artificial proof consists either of indications, arguments or
                            examples. I am well aware that many consider indications to form part of
                            the arguments. My reasons for distinguishing them are twofold. In the
                            first place indications as a rule come under the head of inartificial
                            proofs: for a bloodstained garment, a shriek, a dark blotch and the like
                            are all evidence analogous to documentary or oral evidence and rumours;
                            they are not discovered by the orator, but are given him with the case
                            itself. </p>

                            arguments, since they leave no room for question, while arguments are
                            only possible in controversial matters. If on the other hand they are
                            doubtful, they are not arguments, but require arguments to support them.

                            conclusion and those which do not. The former are those which cannot be

                            For where an indication is irrefutable, there can be no dispute as to

                            for instance, we may argue that he who says that the world was created

                        <p> There is another very similar form of argument, which consists in the
                            inference of facts from their efficient causes or the reverse, a process
                            known as argument from causes. The conclusion is sometimes necessary,
                            sometimes generally without being necessarily true. For instance, a body
                            casts a shadow in the light, and the shadow wherever it falls indicates
                            the presence of a body. </p>

                                everyone that is coloured receives that colour from the sun; a

                                produce dust, nor is everyone that is dusty just come from a

                                wise</quote> ; and again, <quote>It is the part of a good man to act

                                Those who act honourably are considered good, those who act
                                dishonourably are considered bad men. </quote> In these cases the
                            conclusion is correct. On the other hand, <quote> though exercise
                                generally makes the body robust, not everyone who is robust is given
                                to exercise, nor is everyone that is addicted to exercise robust.
                                Nor again, because courage prevents our fearing death, is every man
                                who has no fear of death to be regarded as a brave man; nor is the
                                sun useless to man because it sometimes gives him a headache.

                            formal rules can be laid down. </p>

                        <quote> When Alexander destroyed Thebes, he found documents showing that
                                the Thebans had lent a hundred talents to the Thessalians. These
                                documents he presented to the Thessalians as a reward for the
                                assistance they had given him in the campaign. Subsequently the
                                Thebans, after the restoration of their city by Cassander, demanded
                                that the Thessalians should repay the money. </quote> The case is
                            tried before the Amphictyonic council. It is admitted that the Thebans

                            the approval of the judges, since they are seeking to recover by right

                            violent controversy as to the right of war, since the Thessalians urge

                            property that has fallen into the hands of the victor: the difficulty
                            moreover lies not so much in the proof as in the way it should be put
                            forward. We may begin by stating that the rights of war do not hold good
                            in any matter which can be brought before a court of justice, and that
                            what is taken by force of arms can only be retained by force of arms,
                            and consequently, wherever the rights of war hold good, there is no room
                            for the functions of a judge, while on the contrary where the functions
                            of the judge come into play, the rights of war cease to have any force.

                        <p> The reason why it is necessary to discover this principle is to enable
                            us to bring the following argument into play: that prisoners of war are
                            free on returning to their native land just because the gains of war
                            cannot be retained except by the exercise of the same violence by which
                            they were acquired. Another peculiar feature of the case is that it is
                            tried before the Amphictyonic council, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                           <hi rend="italic">cp.</hi> § 118. The
                                Amphictyonic Council of Delphi in the fourth century B.C. had come
                                to be an international council, in which the great majority of the
                                states of Greece were represented. </note> and you will remember
                            that we have to employ different methods in pleading a case before the
                            centumviral court and before an arbitrator, though the problems of the
                            cases may be identical. </p>

                        <p> Secondly we may urge that the right to refuse payment could not have
                            been conferred by the victor because he possesses only what he holds,
                            but a right, being incorporeal, cannot be grasped by the hand. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            than, once discovered, to defend it with arguments such as that the
                            position of an heir and a conqueror are fundamentally different, since
                            right passes to the one and property to the other. </p>

                            matter of the case that the right over a public debt could not have
                            passed to the victor, because the repayment of a sum of money lent by a
                            whole people is due to them all, and as long as any single one of them
                            survives, he is creditor for the whole amount: but the Thebans were
                            never all of them to a man in Alexander's power. </p>

                    <div n="118" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> The force of this argument resides in the fact that it is not based on
                            any external support, but holds good in itself. Proceeding to the third
                            line of argument we may note that the first portion of it is of a more
                            ordinary type, namely that the right to repayment is not based on the
                            actual document, a plea which can be supported by many arguments. Doubt
                            may also be thrown on Alexander's purpose: did he intend to honour them
                            or to trick them? Another argument peculiar to the subject (indeed it
                            practically introduces a new discussion) is that the Thebans may be
                            regarded as having in virtue of their restoration recovered the right
                            even though it be admitted that they had lost it. Again Cassander's
                            purpose may be discussed, but, as the case is being pleaded before the
                            Amphictyonic council, we shall find that the most powerful plea that can
                            be urged is that of equity. </p>

                            were laid down, and it was only later that writers of rhetoric noted
                            them and collected them for publication. A proof of this is the fact
                            that the examples which they use are old and quoted from the orators,
                            while they themselves discover nothing new or that has not been said

                            orators have not got to be hunted out and noted down in detail. But this
                            does not suffice to make an orator any more than it suffices to learn

                            be true, whereas counsel for the defence may deny <pb n="v4-6 p.313"/>

                            straightforward and, if I may use the phrase, vociferous; but the

                            prepared at home, while the counsel for the defence has frequently to
                            deal with quite unexpected points. The prosecutor brings forward his

                            the deliberative rather than the forensic style. For we shall urge the

                            dissimilarity. For it is impossible for two cases to be alike in every
                            detail. For instance, if the case of Ahala,2 by whom Maelius was killed,
                            is quoted to justify Nasica for the slaying of Tiberius Gracchus, we may
                            argue that Maelius was endeavouring to make himself king, while all that

                            people, and that while Ahala was Master of the Horse, Nasica was a
                            private citizen. In the last resort, if all else prove unavailing, we

                            allege either that they were brought there without his knowledge or
                            deposited with him or given to him and we may therefore answer all these

                            the judges, while frequently arguments which, if stated without more
                            ado, would have removed all doubt, lose their force owing to the delay
                            caused by the elaborate preparations made for their introduction, due to
                            the tact that the advocate thinks that they require additional support.
                            Our orator must therefore adopt a confident manner, and should always
                            speak as if he thought his case admirable. This quality, like all other

                            justified in killing one who lies in wait for us is perfectly true,
                            though irrelevant to the case, for it is not yet clear that Clodius lay

                            of the judge and to place the whole of the case before his eyes, and,
                            even although the facts may have made little impression on him in
                            detail, their cumulative effect is considerable. </p>

                            For if we devote too much time thereto, the peroration will cease to be
                            an enumeration and will constitute something very like a second speech.
                            On the other hand the points selected for enumeration must be treated
                            with weight and dignity, enlivened by apt reflexions and diversified by
                            suitable figures; for there is nothing more tiresome than a dry
                            repetition of facts, which merely suggests a lack of confidence in the

                                in the ordinary courts of Athens during the fourth century as at
                                Rome. When Xenophon ( <hi rend="italic">Mem.</hi> iv. iv. 4) says
                                that Socrates refused to beg mercy of his judges contrary to the
                                law, he seems to refer to the spirit, not the letter. </note> I am
                            less surprised at the philosophers taking this view, for they regard
                            susceptibility to emotion as a vice, and think it immoral that the judge
                            should be distracted from the truth by an appeal to his emotions and
                            that it is unbecoming for a good man to make use of vicious procedure to
                            serve his ends. None the less they must admit that appeals to emotion
                            are necessary if there are no other means for securing the victory of
                            truth, justice and the public interest. </p>

                        <p> It is however admitted by all that recapitulation may be profitably
                            employed in other portions of the speech as well, if the case is
                            complicated and a number of different arguments have been employed in
                            the defence; though no one will doubt but that there are many cases, in
                            which no recapitulation at all is necessary at any point, assuming, that
                            is, that the cases are both brief and simple. This part of the

                        <p> Both parties as a general rule may likewise employ the appeal to the
                            emotions, but they will appeal to different emotions and the defender
                            will employ such appeals with greater frequency and fulness. For the
                            accuser has to rouse the judge, while the defender has to soften him.
                            Still even the accuser will sometimes make his audience weep by the pity
                            excited for the man whose wrongs he seeks to avenge, while the defendant
                            will at times develop no small vehemence when he complains of the
                            injustice of the calumny or conspiracy of which <pb n="v4-6 p.389"/> he
                            is the victim. It will therefore be best to treat these duties
                            separately: as I have already said, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">IV. i. 27, 28.</note> they are much the same in
                            the peroration as in the exordium, but are freer and wider in scope in

                            should gain admittance and we have the whole speech before us. On the
                            other hand in the peroration we have to consider what the feelings of
                            the judge will be when he retires to consider his verdict, for we shall
                            have no further opportunity to say anything and cannot any longer

                            assuage his emotions. And the following brief rule may be laid down for
                            the observation of both parties, that the orator should display the full
                            strength of his case before the eyes of the judge, and, when he has made
                            up his mind what points in his case actually deserve or may seem to
                            deserve to excite envy, goodwill, dislike or pity, should dwell on those

                            outline them. This fuller treatment is specially required if the accused
                            be a man of violent, unpopular or dangerous character or if the <pb n="v4-6 p.391"/> condemnation of the accused is likely to cover the

                        <p> Calvus for example in his speech against Vatinius makes an admirable

                                everybody knows that you know it. </quote> Cicero again in the <hi rend="italic">Verrines</hi>
                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">I. xv. 43.</note> says that the ill-name acquired by the courts may

                            the head of the conciliatory methods mentioned above. The appeal to tear

                            a more prominent place in the peroration than in the exordium, but I
                            have expressed my views on this subject in an earlier book. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">IV . i. 20, 21.</note>

                        <p> The peroration also provides freer opportunities for exciting the
                            passions of jealousy, hatred or anger. As regards the circumstances
                            likely to excite such feelings in the judge, jealousy will be produced
                            by the influence of the accused, hatred by the disgraceful nature of his
                            conduct, and anger by his disrespectful attitude to the court, if, for
                            instance, he be contumacious, arrogant or studiously indifferent: such
                            anger may be aroused not merely by specific acts or words, but by his
                            looks, bearing and manner. In this connexion the remark made by the

                            the goodwill of the judges. Cicero, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See iv. i. 69.</note> as I have already pointed

                            emotion by tears. Such appeals to pity will be based either on the
                            previous or present sufferings of the accused, or on those which await
                            him if condemned. And the force of our appeal will be doubled if we
                            contrast the fortune which he now enjoys with that to which he will be
                            reduced, if he fail. </p>

                                by the agency of those who are now your judges in recalling me to my
                                native land, and cannot I through the same agency retain you in
                                yours? </quote> Such a method is especially serviceable when, as was
                            the case with Milo, entreaty is not in keeping with the character of the

                            to do so? Consequently Cicero sought to win the judges' goodwill for
                            Milo by emphasising the staunchness of his character, and himself
                            assumed the role of suppliant. Impersonation may also be employed with
                            profit in such passages, and by impersonations I mean fictitious
                            speeches supposed to be uttered, such as an advocate puts into the mouth
                            of his client. The bare facts are no doubt moving in themselves; but
                            when we pretend that the persons concerned themselves are speaking, the

                            victims, men whose appearance alone would call forth his tears even
                            though they uttered never a word. And as their plea would awaken yet
                            greater pity if they urged it with their own lips, so it is rendered to
                            some extent all the more effective when it is, as it were, put into

                            crying; to which the boy replied, that his <hi rend="italic">paedagogus</hi> was pinching him. But the most effective warning as
                            to the perils which beset the peroration is the story told by Cicero

                            or else led into making false statements, as for instance if an advocate
                            should say, <quote>He stretches out suppliant hands to embrace your

                            it was an excellent remark that Cassius made to a young orator who said,

                            its failure results in anti-climax, and if the pleader is a feeble

                            he launches a number of witticisms against a youth whose wound had been

                        <p> There are also milder kinds of peroration in which, if our opponent is

                            consists of appeals to the emotions, concerning which I have

                            which forms tile most powerful means of obtaining what we desire, and is
                            also more difficult than any of those which we have previously
                            considered, namely that of stirring the emotions of the judges, and of
                            moulding and transforming them to the attitude which we desire. </p>

                        <p> The few remarks which I have already made on this subject were only such
                            as were essential to my theme, while my purpose was rather to show what
                            ought to be done than to set forth the manner in which we can secure our
                            aim. I must now review the whole subject in a more exhaustive fashion.
                            There is scope for an appeal to the emotions, as I have already said,1
                            in every portion of a speech. Moreover these emotions present great
                            variety, and demand more than cursory treatment, since it is in their
                            handling that the power of oratory shews itself at its highest. Even a

                            life to other departments of oratory, and in developing them to a
                            serviceable extent. At any rate there are, and have always been, a <pb n="v4-6 p.419"/> considerable number of pleaders capable of
                            discovering arguments adequate to prove their points. I am far from
                            despising such, but I consider that their utility is restricted to
                            providing the judge with such facts as it is necessary for him to know,
                            and, to be quite frank, I regard them merely as suitable persons to
                            instruct pleaders of real eloquence in the facts of a case. But few
                            indeed are those orators who can sweep the judge with them, lead him to
                            adopt that attitude of mind which they desire, and compel him to weep
                            with them or share their anger. </p>

                        <p> And yet it is this emotional power that dominates the court, it is this
                            form of eloquence that is the queen of all. For as a rule arguments
                            arise out of the case itself, and the better cause has always the larger
                            number to support it, so that the party who wills by means of them will
                            have no further satisfaction than that of knowing that his advocate did
                            not fail him. </p>

                        <p> But the peculiar task of the orator arises when the minds of the judges
                            require force to move them, and their thoughts have actually to be led
                            away from the contemplation of the truth. No instruction from the
                            litigant can secure this, nor can such power be acquired merely by the
                            study of a brief. Proofs, it is true, may induce the judges to regard
                            our case as superior to that of our opponent, but the appeal to the
                            emotions will do more, for it will make them wish our case to be the
                            better. And what they wish, they will also believe. </p>

                            and is rightly and correctly expressed in Latin by <hi rend="italic">adfectus</hi> (emotion): the other is called <hi rend="italic">ethos,</hi> a word for which in my opinion Latin has no equivalent:
                            it is however rendered <hi rend="italic">by mores</hi> (morals) and
                            consequently the branch of philosophy known as <hi rend="italic">ethics</hi> is styled <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> philosophy by

                            in general that is meant as certain peculiar aspects; for the term <hi rend="italic">morals</hi> includes every attitude of the mind. The
                            more cautious writers have preferred to give the sense of the term
                            rather than to translate it into Latin. They therefore explain <hi rend="italic">pathos</hi>
                        <pb n="v4-6 p.423"/> as describing the more
                            violent emotions and <hi rend="italic">ethos</hi> as designating those
                            which are calm and gentle: in the one case the passions are violent, in
                            the other subdued, the former command and disturb, the latter persuade
                            and induce a feeling of goodwill. </p>

                            usually the ease, I still hold that there are some subjects which demand
                            that the more violent emotion should be continuous. But, although the
                            gentler emotions require less force and impetus, they call for no less
                            art and experience than the more vehement, and are demanded in a greater
                            number of cases, indeed in a certain sense they are required in all.

                            badly, since his words seem to be insincere owing to the absence of <hi rend="italic">ethos</hi> which would otherwise have revealed itself.

                            are so, but also to make ills which are usually regarded as tolerable
                            seem unendurable, as for instance when we represent insulting words as
                            inflicting more grievous injury than an actual blow or represent
                            disgrace as being worse than death. </p>

                            is sometimes positively ridiculous to counterfeit grief, anger and
                            indignation, if we content ourselves with accommodating our words and
                            looks and make no attempt to adapt our own feelings to the emotions to
                            be expressed. What other reason is there for the eloquence with which
                            mourners express their grief; or for the fluency which anger lends even
                            to the uneducated, save the fact that their minds are stirred to power
                            by the depth and sincerity of their feelings? Consequently, </p>

                            affected, and our eloquence must spring from the same feeling that we
                            desire to produce in the mind of the judge. Will he grieve who can find
                            no trace of grief in the words with which I seek to move him to grief?
                            Will he be angry, if the orator who seeks to kindle his anger shows no
                            sign of labouring under the emotion which he demands from his audience?
                            Will he shed tears if the pleader's eyes are dry? It is utterly

                            Accordingly, the first essential is that those feelings should prevail
                            with us that we wish to prevail with the judge, and that we should be

                            possessor of this power of vivid imagination, whereby things, words and
                            actions are presented in the most realistic manner, by the Greek word
                                <foreign xml:lang="grc">εὐφαντασίωτος</foreign> and it is a power

                            visions of which I am speaking to such an extent that we imagine that we
                            are travelling abroad, crossing the sea, fighting, addressing the

                            and seem to ourselves not to be dreaming but acting. Surely, then, it

                            in selecting than zeal in collecting them. For he would then have been
                            less exposed to the censure of his calumniators, although the latter

                        <p> The chief difficulty which confronts the orator in this connexion lies
                            in the fact that sayings designed to raise a laugh are generally untrue
                            (and falsehood always involves a certain meanness), and are often
                            deliberately distorted, and, further, never complimentary: while the
                            judgments formed by the audience on such jests will necessarily vary,
                            since the effect of a jest depends not on the reason, but on an emotion
                            which it is difficult, if not impossible, to describe. </p>

                        <p> For I do not think that anybody can give an adequate explanation, though
                            many have attempted to do so, of the cause of laughter, which is excited
                            not merely by words or deeds, but sometimes even by touch. Moreover,
                            there is great variety in the things which raise a laugh, since we laugh
                            not merely at those words or actions which are smart or witty, but also
                                <pb n="v4-6 p.443"/> at those which reveal folly, anger or fear.
                            Consequently, the cause of laughter is uncertain, since laughter is
                            never far removed from derision. </p>

                            as a trivial matter, and an emotion frequently awakened by buffoons,
                            actors or fools, it has a certain imperious force of its own which it is

                            with well-educated men; in a word, it represents the opposite of
                            rusticity. The meaning of <hi rend="italic">venustus</hi> is obvious;

                            this is not its natural application, although whatever is laughable
                            should have the salt of wit in it. For Cicero, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            laughter; and again when Catullus says— <quote rend="blockquote">

                            certain element of seriousness as well, as in the case of Marcus Caelius
                            the praetor, who, when the consul Isauricus broke his curule chair, had
                            another put in its place, the seat of which was made of leather thongs,
                            by way of allusion to the story that the consul had once been scourged
                            by his father: sometimes, again, it is aroused by an act which passes
                            the grounds of decency, as in the case of Caelius' box, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                                itself open to such censure. The jest must have consisted in some
                                action on the part of the orator. </note> a jest which was not fit

                        <p> On the other hand the joke may lie in some remark about a ridiculous
                            look or gesture; such jests are very attractive, more especially when
                            delivered with every appearance of seriousness; for there are no jests
                            so insipid as those which parade the fact that they are intended to be
                            witty. Still, although the gravity with which a jest is uttered
                            increases its attraction, and the mere fact that the speaker does not
                            laugh himself makes his words laughable, there is also such a thing as a
                            humorous look, manner or <pb n="v4-6 p.453"/> gesture, provided always
                            that they observe the happy mean. Further, a jest will either be free
                            and lively, like the majority of those uttered by Aulus Galba, or
                            abusive, like those with which Junius Bassus recently made us familiar,
                            or bitter, like those of Cassius Severus, or gentle, like those of
                            Domitius Afer. </p>

                        <p> Much depends on the occasion on which a jest is uttered. For in social
                            gatherings and the intercourse of every day a certain freedom is not
                            unseemly in persons of humble rank, while liveliness is becoming to all.
                            Our jests should never be designed to wound, and we should never make it
                            our ideal to lose a friend sooner than lose a jest. Where the battles of
                            the courts are concerned I am always better pleased when it is possible
                            to indulge in gentle raillery, although it is, of course, permissible to
                            be abusive or bitter in the words we use against our opponents, just as
                            it is permissible to accuse them openly of crime, and to demand the last
                            penalty of the law. But in the courts as elsewhere it is regarded as
                            inhuman to hit a man when he is down, either because he is the innocent
                            victim of misfortune or because such attacks may recoil on those who
                            make them. Consequently, the first points to be taken into consideration
                            are who the speaker is, what is the nature of the case, who is the
                            judge, who is the victim, and what is the character of the remarks that
                            are made. </p>

                        <p> It is most unbecoming for an orator to distort his features or use

                            unbecoming are ribald jests, and such as are employed upon the stage. As
                            for obscenity, it should not merely be banished from his language, but
                            should not even be suggested. For even if our <pb n="v4-6 p.455"/>
                            opponent has rendered himself liable to such a charge, our denunciation

                            face was the face of a slave. To this Domitius Afer replied, <quote>Is

                        <p> Brutus was prosecuting Cnaeus Plancus and had produced two readers <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Probably members of his
                                household, employed on this occasion to read out passages from
                                Crassus' previous speeches. </note> to show that Lucius Crassus, who
                            was counsel for the defence, in the speech which he delivered on the
                            subject of the colony of Narbo had advocated measures contrary to those
                            which he recommended in speaking of the Servilian law. Crassus, in
                            reply, called for three readers and gave them the dialogues of Brutus'
                            father to read out. One of these dialogues was represented as taking
                            place on his estate at Privernum, the second on his estate at Alba, and
                            the third on his estate at Tibur. Crassus then asked where these estates
                            were. Now Brutus had sold them all, and in those days it was considered
                            somewhat discreditable to sell one's <pb n="v4-6 p.463"/> paternal
                            acres. Similar attractive effects of narrative may be produced by the
                            narration of fables or at times even of historical anecdotes. </p>

                        <p> On the other hand brevity in wit gives greater point and speed. It may
                            be employed in two ways, according as we are the aggressors, or are
                            replying to our opponents; the method, however, in both cases is to some
                            extent the same. For there is nothing that can be said in attack that
                            cannot be used in riposte. </p>

                            long thought at home, whereas those made in reply are usually improvised
                            during a dispute or the cross-examination of witnesses. But though there
                            are many topics on which we may draw for our jests, I must repeat that

                            this composite character. A like use may be made of dissimilarity. Thus
                            a Roman knight was once drinking at tile games, and Augustus sent him
                            the following message, <quote>If I want to dine, I go home.</quote> To

                            rise to more than one kind of jest. For instance the following jests
                            made by Augustus and Galba differ in form. Augustus was engaged in
                            dismissing an officer with dishonour from his service: the officer kept
                            interrupting him with entreaties and said, <quote>What shall I say to my
                                father?</quote> Augustus replied, <quote>Tell him that I fell under
                                your displeasure.</quote> Galba, when a friend asked him for the
                            loan of a cloak, said, <quote>I cannot lend it you, as I am going to
                                stay at home,</quote> the point being that the rain was pouring
                            through the roof of his garret at the time. I will add a third example,
                            although out of respect to its author I withhold his name: <quote>You
                                are more lustful than a eunuch,</quote> where we are surprised by
                            the appearance of a word which is the very opposite of what we should
                            have expected. Under the same heading, although it is quite different
                            from any of the preceding, we must place the remark made by Marcus
                            Vestinus when it was reported to him that a certain man was dead.
                                <quote>Some day then he will cease to stink,</quote> was his reply.

                            thirty, remarked, <quote>That is true, for I have heard it for the last

                            opponent, as was done by Gaius Caesar, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">A cousin of the father of C. Julius

                            against Curio, who always began his speeches by asking indulgence for

                            by another: for example, Augustus of blessed memory, when the Gauls gave

                                for valour, and Augustus pretends to believe that Dolabella had
                                asked for a military decoration. The point lies in the contrast
                                between the intrinsic value and weight of the two decorations.
                                Further, Augustus was very parsimonious in bestowing military
                                decorations and had himself received the crown of oak leaves from

                            taxed with having omitted them; but with regard to my remarks on the
                            actual practice and manner of jesting, I venture to assert that they are
                            absolutely indispensable. To these Domitius Marsus, who wrote an
                            elaborate treatise on <hi rend="italic">Urbanity,</hi> adds several
                            types of saying, which are not laughable, but rather elegant sayings
                            with a certain charm and attraction of their own, which are suitable
                            even to speeches of the most serious kind: they are characterized by a
                            certain urbane wit, but not of a kind to raise a laugh. </p>

                            quality which he regards as peculiar to this city, though it was not
                            till a late period that it was understood in this sense, after the word
                                <hi rend="italic">Urbs</hi> had come to be accepted as indicating
                            Rome without the addition of any proper noun. He defines it as follows:

                                every kind of emotion, but specially suitable to resistance or

                            brevity, includes all the virtues of oratory. For it is entirely
                            concerned with persons and things to deal with which in appropriate
                            language is nothing more nor less than the task of perfect eloquence.

                            gives the following definition, which is, as he says, based on the views
                            expressed by Cato: <quote> Urbanity is the characteristic of a man who
                                has produced many good sayings and replies, and who, whether in
                                conversation, in social or convivial gatherings, in public speeches,
                                or under any other circumstances, will speak with humour and
                                appropriateness. If any orator do this, he will undoubtedly succeed

                            the remark recorded by Marsus as having been made by Pompey to Cicero
                            when the latter expressed distrust of his party: <quote>Go over to

                            come after the set speeches are done. But since the art of debate turns
                            on invention alone, does not admit of arrangement, has little need for
                            the embellishments of style, and makes no large demand on memory or
                            delivery, I think that it will not be out of place to deal with it here

                            omitted to deal with it on the ground perhaps that they thought the
                            subject had been sufficiently covered by their precepts on other topics.

                        <p> For debate the chief requisites are a quick and nimble understanding and
                            a shrewd and ready judgment. For there is no time to think; the advocate
                            must speak at once and return the blow almost before it has been dealt
                            by his opponent. Consequently while it is most important for every
                            portion of the case that the advocate should not merely have given a
                            careful study to the whole case, but that he should have it at his
                            fingers' ends, when he comes to the debate it is absolutely necessary
                            that he should possess a thorough acquaintance with all the persons,
                            instruments and circumstances of time and place involved: otherwise he
                            will often be reduced <pb n="v4-6 p.507"/> to silence and forced to give
                            a hurried assent to those who prompt him as to what he should say,
                            suggestions which are often perfectly fatuous owing to excess of zeal on
                            the part of the prompter. As a result it sometimes happens that we are
                            put to the blush by too ready acceptance of the foolish suggestions of
                            another. </p>

                        <p> Moreover, we have to deal with others beside these prompters who speak
                            for our ear alone. Somego so far as to turn the debate into an open
                            brawl. For you may sometimes see several persons shouting angrily at the
                            judge and telling him that the arguments thus suggested are contrary to
                            the truth, and calling his attention to the fact that some point which
                            is prejudicial to the case has been deliberately passed over in silence.

                        <p> Consequently the skilled debater must be able to control his tendency to
                            anger; there is no passion that is a greater enemy to reason, while it
                            often leads an advocate right away from the point and forces him both to
                            use gross and insulting language and to receive it in return;
                            occasionally it will even excite him to such an extent as to attack the
                            judges. Moderation, and sometimes even longsuffering, is the better
                            policy, for the statements of our opponents have not merely to be
                            refuted: they are often best treated with contempt, made light of or
                            held up to ridicule, methods which afford unique opportunity for the
                            display of wit. This injunction, however, applies only so long as the
                            case is conducted with order and decency: if, on the other hand, our
                            opponents adopt turbulent methods we must put on a bold front and resist
                            their impudence with courage. </p>

                            bellow at us, interrupt us in the middle of a sentence <pb n="v4-6 p.509"/> and try to throw everything into confusion. While,
                            then, it would be wrong to pay them the compliment of imitation, we must
                            none the less repel their onslaughts with vigour by crushing their
                            insolence and making frequent appeals to the judges or presiding
                            magistrates to insist on the observance of the proper order of speaking.
                            The debater's task is not one that suits a meek temper or excessive
                            modesty, and we are apt to be misled because that which is really
                            weakness is dignified by the name of honesty. </p>

                            themselves are almost always ready for the fray. There is, however, a
                            further device available which consists in suddenly introducing into the

                            is a procedure which resembles a surprise attack or a sally from an
                            ambush. The occasion for its employment arises when there is some point
                            to which it is difficult to improvise an answer, though it would not be
                            difficult to meet if time were allowed for consideration. For solid and
                            irrefutable <pb n="v4-6 p.511"/> arguments are best produced at once in
                            the actual pleading in order that they may be repeated and treated at

                            one's antagonist, makes an unpleasant impression on the judge. It is

                            prove what remains, while if there is only one point at issue, surrender
                            with a good grace will generally secure some mitigation of punishment.
                            For obstinacy in the defence of a fault, more especially after

                            imagined weakness of our own, and will give fresh weight to our proofs

                            Such a course is more effective in debate than in a set speech, for the

                            latter is concerned with hidden facts or such as have not yet been
                            discovered or still remain in doubt. Again judgment is more often than
                            not a matter of <pb n="v4-6 p.517"/> certainty, while sagacity is a form
                            of reasoning from deep-lying premises, which generally weighs and
                            compares a number of arguments and in itself involves both invention and

                            sagacity depends on circumstances and will often find its scope in
                            something preceding the pleading of the cause. For instance in the
                            prosecution of Verres Cicero seems to have shown the highest sagacity in
                            preferring to cut down the time available for his speech rather than
                            allow the trial to be postponed to the following year when Quintus

                            important place. For it is the duty of sagacity to decide what we should
                            say and what we should pass by in silence or postpone; whether it is
                            better to deny an act or to defend it, when we should employ an exordium

                            it is not sufficient for those who are erecting a building merely to
                            collect stone and timber and other building materials, but skilled
                            masons are required to arrange and place them, so in speaking, however
                            abundant the matter may be, it will merely form a confused heap unless
                            arrangement be employed to reduce it to order and to give it connexion

                            cast does not make it a statue: they must be put together; and if you
                            were to interchange some one portion of our bodies or of those of other
                            animals with another, although the body would be in possession of all
                            the same members <pb n="v7-9 p.5"/> as before, you would none the less
                            have produced a monster. Again even a slight dislocation will deprive a
                            limb of its previous use and vigour, and disorder in the ranks will

                            lack cohesion, will fall into countless repetitions and omissions, and,
                            like a traveller who has lost his way in unfamiliar country, will be

                            Put since cases in the courts have always presented an infinite variety,

                            different order in the trial of Ctesiphon, since the accuser begins by
                            dealing with the legal question involved, in which he thought he had the
                            advantage, whereas the advocate for the defence treats practically every
                            other topic before coming to the question of law, with a view to

                            pleasure of the prosecution. Finally, in a case of mutual accusation,

                            arose. 'fake for example the following case. <quote>You killed a

                            insists with some vehemence on the view that the first place should be
                            given to some strong argument, but that the strongest should be reserved
                            to the end, while the weaker arguments should be placed in the middle,
                            since the judge has to be moved at the beginning and forcibly impelled

                            In scholastic themes, for example, the laws are sometimes stated merely
                            with a view to connecting the arguments of the cases. Take the following
                            case: <quote> A father who recognises a son whom he has exposed in
                                infancy, shall only take him back after paying for his keep. A
                                disobedient son may be disinherited. <pb n="v7-9 p.15"/> A man who

                                poor foster-father, and his love for his foster-sister is based on
                                life-long acquaintance. The father, on the other hand, will urge
                                that his payment for his son's nurture has discharged the debt due

                            partition, as for example in the following controversial theme:— <quote>
                                A general, who had stood against his father as a candidate and
                                defeated him, was captured: the envoys who went to ransom him met
                                his father returning from the enemy. He said to the envoys, 'You are

                                father and found gold in his pockets. They pursued their journey and
                                found the general crucified. He cried to them, ' Beware of the
                                traitor.' The father is accused. </quote> What points are admitted

                                told it by the general.</quote> We try to find the traitor. <quote>
                                You admit that you went to the enemy, that you did so by stealth,
                                that you returned unscathed, that you brought back gold and had it

                            on the mind of the judge, it may serve to close his ears to all that is

                            I used also, with reference to the whole material of the case, to do

                            time, since the prosecution and the defence are indifferently permitted
                            to state a case and refute it in the same declamation. But in the
                            majority of controversial themes it is not even possible to discover who
                            should speak first, as for instance in the following: <quote> A certain
                                man had three sons, an orator, a philosopher and a physician. In his
                                will he divided his property into four portions, three of which he
                                distributed equally among his sons, while the fourth was to go to
                                the son who rendered the greatest service to his country.

                            what reply can be made to so equitable a demand? The answer is clear:—
                                <quote> There is a law which disinherits the man who fails to appear
                                in his father's defence when the latter is accused of treason, and
                                you failed to appear. </quote> This statement will be followed by
                            the necessary praise of the law and denunciation of the man who failed

                            facts. Let us now return to the claimant. Unless he is hopelessly
                            unintelligent, surely the following argument will suggest itself:—
                                <quote> If the law bars the way, there is no ground for action and
                                the trial becomes a farce. But it is beyond question that the law
                                exists and that the uneducated son did commit the offence for which
                                it enacts a punishment. </quote> What then shall we say? <quote>I
                                had no education.</quote>
                     </p>

                    <div n="49" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> But if the law applies to all men, it will be of no avail to plead lack
                            of education. We must therefore try to discover whether there be not
                            some point on which the law can be invalidated. We turn for guidance to
                            nature (a point on which I cannot insist too often); what does she
                            suggest save that when the letter of the law is against us, we should
                            discuss its intention? This introduces the general question whether we
                            are to stand by the letter or the spirit. But if we argue this question
                            on general grounds with reference to law in the abstract, we shall go on
                            for ever; it is a question that has never been decided. We must
                            therefore restrict our enquiry to the particular law on which our case
                            turns and try to find some argument against adhesion to the strict

                            following arguments will spontaneously suggest themselves. <quote>Is an

                            cast into prison: take for example the case of the mother who gave
                            evidence against her son when accused of being an alien, or of the
                            father who sold his son to a procurer. What, then, is there in the
                            present case that we lay hold of as regards the character of the father?

                            us not despair. It is probable that the intention of the legislator was
                            that innocent parents should secure the support of their children. But
                            the uneducated son will be ashamed to produce this argument, since he

                            together with his advocate. It seems almost impossible that in one and

                            which makes no exception, and will argue that the reason for enacting a
                            penalty against those who fail to appear for their fathers was to
                            prevent their being deterred from the defence of their fathers by the

                            relax our efforts: for so far all the arguments might have been used
                            even if the father had not been recalled from exile. But we must not
                            betake ourselves at once to the obvious point that he was recalled by
                            the agency of the uneducated son. A little ingenuity will lead us to

                            the sentence of the court and is tantamount to the trial never having
                            taken place at all. The uneducated son will therefore attempt to argue
                            that, being entitled to not more than one reward, there was no means by
                            which he could have secured the recall of his kin save by the
                            restoration of his father on the same terms as if he had never been
                            accused, and that this fact carries with it the cancellation of the
                            penalty incurred by his advocate, as though he had never defended his

                        <p> Our next point will be that which first occurred to us, namely the plea
                            that he was recalled by the agency of the uneducated son. At this point
                            we are confronted by the question whether the son who secured his
                            father's restoration is thereby to be regarded in the light of an
                            advocate, since he secured for him precisely what his original advocate
                            demanded for him, and it is not an unreasonable claim to ask that an
                            action should be regarded as equivalent when it is really more than
                            equivalent. </p>

                        <p> The remaining points turn on questions of equity, for we ask which of
                            the two sons makes the juster claim. This question admits of still
                            further division. The claim of the uneducated son would have been the
                            juster even if both had claimed the whole property. How much more so
                            when one claims only a half and the other the whole to the exclusion of
                            his brother. And then, even after we have dealt with all these points,
                            an appeal to the memory of his father will carry great weight with the
                            judges, more especially as the dispute is about the father's estate.
                            This will give rise to conjecture as to what the intentions <pb n="v7-9 p.45"/> of the father were at the time of his dying
                            intestate. This conjecture, however, involves a question of <hi rend="italic">quality,</hi> and is employed in the service of a

                            Questions concerning facts are either general or definite, that is to
                            say, those which involve consideration of persons and those which do

                            when the question turns on some fact, the point on which doubt arises is
                            either what has been done, or what is being done, or what is likely to
                            be done. For example, in general questions we discuss whether the

                            or <hi rend="italic">is likely</hi> some day to come to an end. In
                            definite questions, on the other hand, we discuss whether Roscius <hi rend="italic">has</hi> murdered his father, whether Manlius <hi rend="italic">is</hi> aiming at making himself king, or Quintus
                            Caecilius <hi rend="italic">will be</hi> justified in appearing as the

                        <p> In the law courts past time is of most importance, since all accusations

                            or is likely to be done is inferred from the past. We also enquire into
                            origins. For instance, we enquire whether a pestilence be due to the
                            anger of heaven, the inclement weather, the pollution of the
                            water-supply, or the noxious vapours emitted by the earth. Again, we
                            seek for the motives of an act. For example, we enquire whether the
                            fifty kings who sailed against Troy did so because they were bound by
                            their oath, or were moved to do so by righteous indignation, or merely
                            desired to gratify the sons of Atreus. There is no very great difference
                            between these two classes of question. </p>

                            number, such as whether the sun is greater than the earth, whether the
                            moon is spherical, flat or conical, whether there is one universe or
                            several, or, </p>

                        <p> to go outside these physical speculations, whether the Trojan or the
                            Peloponnesian war was the greatest, what was the nature of the shield of
                            Achilles, or whether there was more than one Hercules. In forensic
                            cases, however, which consist of accusation and defence, there is one
                            kind of conjecture by which we enquire both about an act and about its
                            author. This sometimes treats the two questions together, as, for
                            example, when both the act and the identity of the author are denied,
                            and sometimes separately, as when the first enquiry, whether the act was
                            committed, is followed by a second, where, the act being admitted, the
                            question is by whom it was committed. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div n="8" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> The act itself again sometimes involves a single question, as, for
                            example, <pb n="v7-9 p.51"/> whether a man is dead, and sometimes two,
                            as, for instance, whether he died of poison or of some internal disease.
                            Another form of conjecture is concerned with the act alone, it being
                            admitted that if the act was really committed, there can be no doubt as
                            to its author. A third form is concerned solely with the author, the act
                            being admitted and the dispute turning on the question as to who
                            committed it. This third form is complex. </p>

                            accuses another of having done it. Further, there is more than one way
                            of transferring the charge to another. At times this results in <hi rend="italic">mutual accusation,</hi> which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντικατηγορία,</foreign> and some of our own authors

                            charge is transferred to some person who cannot be brought to trial, and
                            may be either known or unknown: again, if the person is known, he may be
                            someone outside the case or the victim himself, who may be alleged to
                            have committed suicide. </p>

                            the same way as in eases of mutual accusation. Cicero, for instance, in
                            the <hi rend="italic">pro Vareno</hi> diverts the charge from the
                            accused to the slaves of Ancharius and in the <hi rend="italic">pro

                        <p> There is also a different form of comparison, which comes into play when
                            both parties claim the credit of some act, and yet another kind, when
                            the question is not as between two persons, but as between two acts;
                            that is to say, the question is not which of the two committed an act,
                            but which of two acts was committed. Finally, if the act and the
                            identity of the author are both <pb n="v7-9 p.53"/> admitted, we may
                            still raise the question of his intention. I shall now proceed to
                            detail. As an example of joint denial covering both the act and the
                            identity of the author we may take the following statements, <quote>I
                                have not committed adultery,</quote>
                        <quote>I have not sought to
                                establish myself as tyrant.</quote> In cases of murder or poisoning
                            the denial is often divided as follows: </p>

                    <div n="12" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p>
                        <quote>The act was not committed, and, if it was committed, it was not by
                                me.</quote> But if the defence say, <quote>Prove that the man was
                                killed,</quote> the burden falls solely on the accuser, for the
                            accused can say nothing more against the charge except perhaps in the
                            way of casting certain suspicions, which he should throw out in the
                            vaguest terms, since if you make one definite assertion, you will have
                            to prove it or run the risk of losing your case. For when the question
                            lies between our statement and that of our opponent, one or other will
                            be regarded as true. Thus when the point on which we relied for our
                            defence is overthrown, there is nothing left but the points that tell
                            against us. </p>

                        <p> For example, when the question turns on symptoms, which may point either
                            to poisoning or internal disease, there is no third course left open and
                            consequently each party sticks to his statement. At times the question
                            turns on the nature of the fact, whether, for instance, death was due to
                            poisoning or internal disease, and arguments are introduced which are
                            drawn from the circumstances alone without any reference to the person
                            concerned. </p>

                        <p> For example, it makes a difference whether the deceased was cheerful or

                            sleeping previous to the festive gathering that <pb n="v7-9 p.55"/> was
                            followed by his death. The age of the deceased is also an important
                            factor, and it is desirable to know whether he died suddenly or after a
                            long period of ill health. If the question turns only on his sudden
                            death, both parties will have still freer scope for discussion. </p>

                        <p> At times the character of the accused may be adduced to prove the fact,
                            and to make it likely that it was or was not a case of poisoning because
                            the accused is or is not a likely person to have committed such an act.
                            When, on the other hand, the enquiry concerns both the accused and the
                            act, the natural order for the accuser to pursue is to commence by
                            proving that the act has been committed and then to go on to show that
                            it was committed by the accused. If, however, proofs of the authorship
                            of the crime are more in number than the proofs of the commission, this
                            order may be reversed. </p>

                        <p> On the other hand, the accused will always begin by denying the act,

                            anything more, while if it is not proved, there remain other means of
                            defence. Similarly, when the dispute turns solely on the act and, the
                            act being proved, there can be no doubt as to the author, arguments may
                            be drawn in like manner both from the person and the facts, although

                            to the student. <quote> A man who had been disinherited by his father
                                took to the study of medicine. His father fell sick and, his life

                                said he would cure him if <pb n="v7-9 p.57"/> he would take a
                                draught prescribed by himself. The father after drinking part of the
                                draught said that he had been poisoned: the son drank the remainder
                                of the draught. The father died and the son is accused of parricide.

                            character of the accused. There remains a third type of conjectural case
                            where the fact is admitted, and the only question is as to the author.
                            It is unnecessary for me to quote examples, since such cases are of
                            frequent occurrence. For example, it may be clear that a man has been
                            killed or that sacrilege has been committed, but the person accused of
                            the crime may deny his guilt. It is from such circumstances that cases
                            of mutual accusation arise, where it is admitted that the crime has been
                            committed, but each party charges the other with being the author. </p>

                            for the jury is empanelled to try one accused person only, and even
                            though the defence and the prosecution may accuse each other of tile

                            and even in the courts the fact of mutual accusation will involve <pb n="v7-9 p.59"/> no difference in the pleadings, since the same

                            weight if we have first proved our own innocence, and thirdly, we shall
                            thus secure a double line of defence. For the man who says, <quote>I did

                            that of our adversary, or we may compare individual arguments. The
                            choice between these two methods can only be determined by the
                            requirements of the case. For example, in the <hi rend="italic">pro

                            individual arguments: for it would have been rash in connexion with the

                        <p> The class of case last mentioned by me is, however, not merely of
                            frequent occurrence in the schools, but sometimes actually occurs in the
                            courts. For example, the sole question in the case of Naevius of Arpinum
                            was whether he threw his wife out of the window or she threw herself. My
                            speech in this case is the only one of all my pleadings that I have so
                            far published, and I admit that I was led to do so merely by a youthful
                            desire for glory. For the other speeches which circulate as mine have
                            little in them that actually fell from my lips, having been corrupted by
                            the carelessness of the shorthand-writers who took them down with a view
                            to making money out of them. </p>

                        <p> There is also another type of conjectural case which, though it involves
                            two questions, is different from cases of mutual accusation; such cases
                            are concerned with rewards and may be illustrated by the following
                            controversial theme. <quote> A tyrant, suspecting that his physician had
                                given him poison, tortured him and, since he persisted in denying
                                that he had done so, sent for a second physician. The latter
                                asserted that poison had been administered, but that he would
                                provide an antidote; he gave him a draught: the tyrant drank it and
                                died. Both physicians claim a reward for slaying the tyrant.
                            </quote> Now just as in cases of mutual accusation where each party
                            shifts the guilt to his opponent, so in this <pb n="v7-9 p.63"/> case we
                            compare the characters, motives, means, opportunities, instruments and

                        <p> Does not the whole suit consist of comparison between the two cases and
                            of two different and opposite sets of conjecture? But the method to be
                            followed is identical whether the case be one of accusation and defence
                            or of claim and denial of the claim. Conjecture is, in the first place,
                            based on what is past, under which I include persons, causes and intent.
                            For in dealing with a case we first ask what the accused intended to do,
                            next what he was in a position to do, and lastly what he actually did.
                            Consequently the first point on which we must fix our attention is the
                            character of the accused. </p>

                        <p> It is the business of the accuser to make any charge that <pb n="v7-9 p.65"/> he may bring against the accused not merely
                            discreditable, but as consistent as possible with the crime for which he
                            is arraigned. For example, if he calls a man accused of murder a
                            debauchee or an adulterer, the discredit attaching to such charges will
                            no doubt tell against the accused, but will, on the other hand, do less
                            to prove the case than if he shows him to be bold, insolent, cruel or
                            reckless. </p>

                            impossible, show that they are not relevant to the case. For there are
                            many charges which not only have no mutual resemblance, but may even at
                            times contradict each other, as for instance if a man accused of theft
                            is called prodigal or careless. For it is not likely that one and the
                            same man should at once despise money and covet it. </p>

                            all, and that the accusers ventured to make such false charges merely
                            because they hoped by injuring and insulting the accused to be able to

                            of the case by the prosecution. The defence may begin by drawing
                            arguments from the person involved, and will at times urge on general
                            grounds that it is incredible that a father has been killed by his son
                            or that a commander has betrayed his country to the enemy. The answer to
                            such arguments is easy, for we may <pb n="v7-9 p.67"/> urge that bad men
                            are capable of every crime, as is shown by every-day occurrences, or
                            that the atrocious nature of a crime is but a poor argument against its
                            having been committed. </p>

                            person involved. This may be done in various ways: rank, for example,
                            may be pleaded in defence of the accused, or at times, on the other
                            hand, may be employed to prove his guilt on the ground that he trusted
                            to his rank to secure impunity. Similarly poverty, humble rank, wealth
                            may be used as arguments for or against the accused according to the
                            talent of the advocate. </p>

                            against his character, counsel for the defence will lay great stress on
                            this fact, while the accuser will attempt to restrict the judge to the

                            and will say that there must always be a first step in crime and that a

                            the judges to believe that it is not so much that he is unable, as that
                            he is unwilling to bring any charge against the character of the
                            accused. Consequently it is better to abstain from casting any slur on

                            charges which are manifestly false, since such a proceeding discredits
                            the rest of our argument. Further, the advocate who brings <pb n="v7-9 p.69"/> no charges against the accused may be believed to
                            have omitted all reference to past offences on the ground that such
                            reference was not necessary, while the advocate who heaps up baseless
                            charges thereby admits that his only argument is to be found in the past
                            life of the accused, and that he has deliberately preferred to risk
                            defeat on this point rather than say nothing at all about it. </p>

                            any crime, and to exaggerate the particular motives which he selects for

                            committed the act, all enquiry into motive is irrelevant or that a
                            motiveless crime is even more abominable than one which has a motive.
                            Counsel for the defence, on the other hand, will, wherever it be
                            possible, emphasise the point that it is incredible that any act should
                            be committed without a motive. Cicero develops this point with great
                            energy in a number of his speeches, but more especially in his defence
                            of Varenus, who had everything else against him and was as a matter of
                            fact condemned. </p>

                            the motive alleged is <pb n="v7-9 p.71"/> false or inadequate or unknown
                            to the accused. For it is possible that a man may be quite ignorant of
                            motives imputed to him. He may not, for example, have known whether the
                            man whom he is accused of having killed had appointed him his heir or
                            intended to prosecute him. All else failing, we may urge that motives
                            are not necessarily of importance. For what man is there who is not
                            liable to the emotions of fear, hatred or hope, and yet numbers of
                            persons act on these motives without committing crime? </p>

                            persons. For example, although poverty may in certain cases be a motive
                            for theft, it will not have the same force with men such as Curius or
                            Fabricius. </p>

                        <p> The question has been raised as to whether we should deal first with
                            persons or motives, and different orators have given different answers:
                            Cicero as a rule prefers to treat motives first. For my own part, if the
                            circumstances of the case do not point strongly in either direction, I
                            consider that the most natural course is to begin by dealing with
                            persons. For the enquiry whether any crime can credibly be imputed to
                            such a man as the accused is of a more general character than the
                            question whether some one particular crime can be imputed, and in
                            addition involves a greater correctness in division. </p>

                            but also causes leading to error, such as drunkenness or ignorance. For
                            just as such considerations lessen the guilt of a crime when regarded
                            from the point of view of its quality, so they tell heavily against the

                            them, as, for example, in cases of theft or adultery, crimes which carry

                            killed Clodius with impunity. There is also the question why the accused
                            should have chosen that particular place or time or means for the
                            commission of the crime, a topic to which Cicero gives a thorough

                            (for it is a common saying that crimes are irrational), or finally,
                            whether he was led astray by the fact that crime had become a habit with
                            him. <pb n="v7-9 p.75"/> Having dealt with the question whether he
                            intended to commit the crime, we proceed to the question whether he was
                            in a position to commit it. Under this head we discuss the place and
                            occasion of the offence. For instance, in a case of theft we ask whether
                            it was committed in a secluded or frequented spot, in the daytime, when
                            witnesses are more numerous, or by night, when success is more
                            difficult. </p>

                        <p> Consequently we shall consider all the circumstances rendering the act
                            difficult or easy of accomplishment; these require no illustration,
                            being numerous and familiar. This second topic is of such importance
                            that, if it is impossible to give it satisfactory treatment, the case
                            falls to the ground; if, however, we succeed in dealing with it
                            adequately, we must proceed to consider whether the accused actually
                            committed the act. But this topic involves conjecture as to intention,
                            for it is from these facts that we infer whether he hoped for success or
                            not. Therefore we must also consider the question of the means at his
                            disposal, such, for example, as the retinues of Clodius and Milo. </p>

                            those of others that we derive the greatest advantage, as, for example,
                            when our opponent has done something which tells in our favour: but our

                            will always tell against us, as, for example, in the following
                            controversial theme. <quote> A son, on being asked where his father was,
                                replied: 'Wherever he is, he is alive.' But the father was found

                        <p> Finally, whereas our own words and deeds can only be justified by their
                            intention, the deeds and words of others can be disposed of in a number
                            of different ways. My remarks on this subject have, I think, been
                            confined to one very important class of conjectural cases, but something
                            of what I have said will apply to all cases. For example, in cases
                            concerned with <pb n="v7-9 p.79"/> theft, deposits and loans, arguments
                            are derived both from possibilities (as when we enquire whether there
                            was any money to deposit), and from persons, as when we raise the
                            question whether it is credible that anyone deposited money with this
                            man or trusted him with a loan, or that the claimant is bringing a false
                            accusation, or that the accused repudiates his debt or is a thief. </p>

                    <div n="51" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> But even in the case of an accusation of theft, just as in an accusation
                            of murder, we enquire both into the act and the author, while in cases
                            concerned with loans and deposits there are also two questions (though
                            these are always distinct from one another), namely, whether the money
                            was delivered and whether it has been repaid. Cases of adultery are
                            marked by the following peculiarity, that, as a rule, the safety of two
                            persons is involved, and it is necessary to say something of the past
                            life of both, although some have raised the question whether both
                            parties should be defended together. The line to be taken must depend on
                            the circumstances of the individual case: if the defence of one party
                            lends support to the defence of the other, I should defend them
                            conjointly; if the reverse is the case, I should treat the two cases
                            separately. </p>

                        <p> However, that no one may think me somewhat hasty in saying that two
                            persons are as a rule involved in charges of adultery, I would point out
                            that I would not assert that this is always the case. The woman alone
                            may be accused of adultery with a person unknown: we may say, <quote>
                                Gifts were found in the house, and money from some unknown source,
                                and love-letters whose destination cannot be ascertained.

                            document always regards it as necessary to support the signatory, but

                            of the act which is in doubt, since the question is whether he has

                        <p> There is a different type of question where the dispute is concerned
                            with the term to be applied, which depends on the letter of the law: it
                            is a form of question which can only arise in the courts from the actual
                            words on which the dispute turns. Take as examples the questions,
                            whether suicide is a form of homicide, or whether the man who forces a
                            tyrant to kill himself can be considered a tyrannicide, or whether
                            magical incantations are equivalent to the crime of poisoning. In all
                            these cases there is no doubt about the facts, for it is well known that
                            there is a difference between killing oneself and killing another,
                            between slaying a tyrant and forcing him to suicide, between employing
                            incantations and administering a deadly draught, but we enquire whether

                            who follows many authorities in saying that definition is concerned with

                            for my own part I consider that definition falls into three types, which
                            I may perhaps call <hi rend="italic">species.</hi>

                        <p> For at times it is convenient merely to <pb n="v7-9 p.89"/> enquire
                            whether one particular term is applicable to a given thing, as in the
                            question whether an act committed in a brothel is adultery. If we deny
                            that it is adultery, there is no need to state what it should be called,
                            since we have given a total denial to the charge. Secondly, there are
                            occasions when the question is which of two terms is to be applied to a
                            thing, as in the question whether an act is theft or sacrilege. It may
                            be sufficient for the defence that it is not sacrilege, but it is still
                            necessary to show what else it is, and therefore we must define both.

                        <p> Thirdly, there are times when the question concerns things which are
                            different in species, and we ask whether two different things are to be
                            called by the same name, in spite of the fact that each has a special
                            name of its own: for example, is tile same name applicable both to a

                            of this kind the question is whether one thing is another thing as well,
                            since the name in doubt does without question apply to something else.
                            It is sacrilege to steal a sacred object from a temple; is it also
                            sacrilege to steal private property from a temple? It is adultery to lie
                            with another man's wile in one's own house; is it adultery to do so in a
                            brothel? It is tyrannicide to slay a tyrant; is it tyrannicide to force
                            him to slay himself? </p>

                            a weaker form of definition, since while definition seeks to determine
                            whether one thing has the same name as another, syllogism seeks to
                            determine whether one thing is to be regarded as identical with another.

                            about which they are really in agreement: thus rhetoric is defined as

                                <hi rend="italic">correct conception</hi> or <hi rend="italic">correct expression</hi> of what we have to say, as the science of

                                with the result that the guest dies of indigestion. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> Nor is the act of the young men to be
                                regarded as the sole cause of death. The credulity of the old man
                                and his inability to bear the shock of grief were contributory
                                causes. Finally, had lie been wiser or made of sterner stuff, he
                                would still be alive. Moreover the young men acted without the least
                                thought of doing harm, and the father might have suspected from the
                                position of the tomb and the traces of haste in its construction
                                that it was not a genuine tomb. What ground then is there for
                                condemning them, for everything else that constitutes homicide is

                        <p> Sometimes we have a settled definition on which both parties are agreed,

                        <p>IV. In speaking of
                            quality we sometimes use the word in its most general sense, which
                            covers a number of different questions. For we enquire sometimes into
                            the nature and form of things: as for instance whether the soul is
                            immortal or whether god is to be conceived of in human form. Sometimes,
                            on the other hand, the question turns on size and number, as, for
                            instance, what is the size of the sun or whether there are more worlds
                            than one. In all these cases we arrive at our conclusions by conjecture,
                            yet each involves a question of quality. </p>

                        <p> Such questions are sometimes treated in deliberative themes: for
                            example, if Caesar is deliberating whether to attack Britain, he must
                            enquire into the nature of the Ocean, consider whether Britain is an
                            island (a fact not then ascertained), and estimate its size and the
                            number of troops which lie will require for the invasion. Under the same
                            head of quality fall questions whether certain things should be done or
                            not and certain objects sought or avoided: such topics are specially
                            adapted for deliberative themes, but occur with some frequency in
                            controversial themes as well, the only difference being that in the

                            with rewards or penalties or their quantity. The case is therefore of
                            two kinds, simple or comparative, the former dealing with what is just,
                            the latter with what is juster, or most just. When the point for
                            decision is the penalty to be inflicted, the duty of the pleader will be
                            to defend, extenuate or excuse the act on which the charge is based, or
                            even, according to some, to plead for mercy. </p>

                        <p> By far the strongest line that can be taken in defence is to assert that
                            the act which forms the subject of the charge is actually honourable. A
                            man is disinherited because he went on military service, stood for
                            office or married without his father's consent. We defend this act. This
                            form of defence is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">κατ᾽

                            by objection, the term being used with reference to the purport of the
                            defendant's plea. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                           <foreign xml:lang="grc">ἀντίληψις</foreign> is the technical term for
                                this form of defence which turns not on the facts, but on the
                                justice of the case. The meaning of <hi rend="italic">ad intellectum
                                    id nomen referentes</hi> is obscure. If the words are correct
                                (and no satisfactory correction seems possible), their meaning must
                                be that the defence turns not on the act, but on its significance
                                and equity. If any change is made in the text, the simplest course
                                is to delete the words as a gloss which has crept into the text.
                            </note> I can find no exact Latin translation of the term; we call it an
                            absolute defence. But in such cases the question is concerned with the

                            must not be adopted without consideration: for to retaliate, or meet
                            violence with violence on the one hand, does not imply injustice on the
                            part of the aggressor, while on the other hand it does not follow that
                            the first act was just merely because the two acts were alike. In cases

                            regarded as a positive good: for example, Mancinus may defend the treaty

                        <p> Such are the methods by which we may <pb n="v7-9 p.113"/> defend an act.
                            If it is impossible to defend an act either on its merits or with the
                            assistance of arguments from without, the next best course will be to
                            shift the charge, if possible, to another. It is for this reason that
                            the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> of <hi rend="italic">competence</hi>
                            has been held to apply even to those who cannot plead the letter of the

                           <hi rend="italic">i e.</hi> there are no legal grounds for alleging

                            then, the blame will be thrown on a person: for example, Gracchus, when
                            accused of making the treaty with the Numantines (and it was fear of
                            this accusation that seems to have led him to bring forward the
                            democratic laws of his tribuneship) may plead that he made it as the
                            representative of his commander-in-chief. </p>

                        <p> At times, on the other hand, the blame may be shifted to some thing: for
                            instance, a person who has failed to comply with some testamentary
                            injunction may plead that the laws forbade such compliance. The Greek

                            If these methods of defence are out of the question, we must take refuge
                            in making excuses. We may plead ignorance. For example, if a man has
                            branded a runaway slave and the latter is subsequently adjudged to be a
                            free man, he may deny that he was cognisant of the truth. Or we may
                            plead necessity; for instance, if a soldier overstays his leave, he may
                            plead that his return was delayed by floods or ill health. </p>

                            for mercy have a legitimate place. In such cases there are three points
                            based on the circumstances of the accused which are most effective. The
                            first is drawn from his previous life, if he has been blameless in his
                            conduct and deserved well of the state, or if there is good hope that
                            his conduct will be blameless for the future and likely to be of some
                            use to his fellow men; the second is operative if it appears that he has
                            been sufficiently <pb n="v7-9 p.117"/> punished already on the ground
                            that he has suffered other misfortunes, or that his present peril is
                            extreme, or that he has repented of his sin; while thirdly we may base
                            his appeal on his external circumstances, his birth, his rank, his
                            connexions, his friendships. </p>

                        <p> It is, however, on the judge that we shall pin our highest hopes, if the
                            circumstances be such that acquittal will result in giving him a
                            reputation for clemency rather than for regrettable weakness. But even
                            in the ordinary courts appeals for mercy are frequently employed to a
                            large extent, although they will not colour the whole of our pleading.
                            For the following form of division is common:— <quote>Even if he had
                                committed the offence, he would have deserved forgiveness,</quote> a
                            plea which has often turned the balance in doubtful cases, while

                        <p> Sometimes indeed the whole case may rest on such considerations. For
                            example, if a father has made an express declaration that he has
                            disinherited his son because lie was in love with a woman of the town,
                            will not the whole question turn on the point whether it was the
                            father's duty to pardon such an offence and whether it is the duty of
                            the centumviral court to overlook it? Nay, even in penal prosecutions
                            governed by strict forms of law we raise two separate questions: first
                            whether the penalty has been incurred, and secondly whether, if so, it
                            ought to be inflicted. Still the view of the authorities to whom I have
                            referred that an accused person cannot be saved from the clutches of the
                            law by this method of defence is perfectly correct. </p>

                        <p> With regard to rewards, there are two questions which confront us:
                            namely, whether the claimant is <pb n="v7-9 p.119"/> deserving of any
                            reward, and, if so, whether he deserves so great a reward. If there are
                            two claimants, we have to decide which is the more worthy of the two; if
                            there are a number, who is the most worthy. The treatment of these
                            questions turns on the kind of merit possessed by the claimants. And we
                            must consider not merely the act (whether it has merely to be stated or
                            has to be compared with the acts of others), but the person of the
                            claimant as well. For it makes a great difference whether a tyrannicide
                            be young or old, man or woman, a stranger or a connexion. </p>

                        <p> The place may also be discussed in a number of ways: was the city in

                            always been free? was he killed in the citadel or in his own house? The
                            means, too, and the time call for consideration: was he killed by poison
                            or the sword? was he killed in time of peace or war, when he was
                            intending to lay aside his power or to venture on some fresh crime? </p>

                        <p> Further, in considering the question of merit, the danger and difficulty
                            of the act will carry great weight, while with regard to liberality it
                            will similarly be of importance to consider the character of the person
                            from whom it proceeds. For liberality is more pleasing in a poor man
                            than in a rich, in one who confers than in one who returns a benefit, in
                            a father than in a childless man. Again, we must consider the immediate
                            object of the gift, the occasion and the intention, that is to say,
                            whether it was given in the hope of subsequent profit; and so on with a
                            number of similar considerations. The question of <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> therefore makes the highest demands on the resources
                            of oratory, since it affords the utmost scope for a display of talent on

                            eloquence is to demonstrate <hi rend="italic">quality:</hi> there lies
                            its kingdom, there its power, and there its unique victory. Verginius
                            includes under <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> cases concerned with
                            disinheritance, lunacy, cruelty to a wife, and claims of female orphans
                            to marry relatives. The questions thus involved are, it is true,
                            frequently questions of <hi rend="italic">quality,</hi> while some

                            did, acted with the best intentions. I could quote many examples of this
                            kind. Again, it is definition which tells us what precisely is meant by

                            ravisher or an adulterer: in the second case it is for a crime which is
                            still incomplete and terminable <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Literally <hi rend="italic">conditional.</hi>
                                The sense, however, is that the disinheritance is only conditional

                            will be the case where the son is disinherited because of disobedience
                            to his father. The first form of disinheritance always demands a certain
                            harshness when the father pleads his case, since the act is irrevocable,
                            whereas in the latter his pleading will be of a kindly and almost
                            persuasive nature, since he would prefer not to disinherit him. On the
                            other hand, the pleading of the sons should in both cases be of a
                            subdued character and couched in a conciliatory tone. </p>

                            praises his past character, the easier will it be to prove the change

                            for pardon. For these are domestic quarrels, in which the fact that the
                            offence is an isolated case, due to error and of a less serious

                        <p> Lawyers frequently raise the question of the letter and the intention of
                            the law, in fact a large proportion of legal disputes turn on these
                            points. We need not therefore be surprised that such questions occur in
                            the schools as well, where they are often invented with this special
                            purpose. One form of this kind of question is found in cases where tile
                            enquiry turns both on the letter and the spirit <pb n="v7-9 p.137"/> of

                            opponent. Take for example the following case. <quote> A thief shall

                                stolen 10,000 sesterces. 40,000 are claimed from each. They claim
                                that they are liable only to pay 20,000 each. </quote> The accuser
                            will urge that the sum which he claims is fourfold the amount stolen;
                            the accused will urge that the sum which they offer to pay is fourfold.
                            The intention of the law will be pleaded by both parties. </p>

                            clear in one sense and doubtful in another. <quote> The son of a harlot
                                shall not address the people. A woman who had a son became a

                            Here there is no doubt about the son of one who was a prostitute before
                            his birth, but it is doubtful whether the law applies to the case of one

                        <p> Another question which is not infrequently raised is as to the
                            interpretation of the law forbidding an action to be brought twice on
                            the same dispute, the problem being whether the word <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> refers to the prosecutor or the prosecution. Such are
                            the points arising out of the obscurity of the law. A second form of
                            question turns on some passage where the meaning is clear. Those who
                            have given exclusive attention to this class of question call it the <hi rend="italic">basis concerned with the obvious expression of the law

                        <p> There are three different methods in which we may combat the letter. The
                            first comes into play where it is clear that it is impossible always to
                            observe the letter of the law. <quote>Children shall support their
                                parents under penalty of imprisonment.</quote> It is clear, in the
                            first place, that this cannot apply to an infant. At this point we shall
                            turn to other possible exceptions and distinguish as follows. <quote>
                                Does this apply to everyone who refuses to support his parent? Has
                                this particular individual incurred the penalty by this particular
                                act? </quote>

                        <p> The second arises in scholastic themes where no argument can be drawn
                            from the particular law, but the question is concerned solely with the
                            subject of the dispute. <quote> A foreigner who goes up on to the wall
                                shall be liable to capital punishment. The enemy had scaled the wall
                                and were driven back by a foreigner. His punishment is demanded.
                            </quote>
                     </p>
                    </div>
                    <div n="7" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> In this case we shall not have two separate questions, namely, whether
                            every foreigner who goes up on the wall is liable to the penalty, and
                            whether this particular foreigner is liable, since no more forcible
                            argument can be brought against the application of the letter of the law
                            than the fact in dispute, but the only question to be raised will be
                            whether a foreigner may not go on to the wall even for the purpose of
                            saving the city. Therefore we shall rest our case on equity and the
                            intention of the law. It is, however, sometimes possible to draw
                            examples from other laws to show that we cannot always stand by the
                            letter, as Cicero did in his defence of Caecina. </p>

                        <p> The third method becomes operative when we find something in the actual
                            words of the law which enables us to prove that the intention of the
                            legislator was different. <pb n="v7-9 p.141"/> The following theme will
                            provide an example. <quote> Anyone who is caught at night with steel in
                                his hands shall be thrown into prison. A man is found wearing a
                                steel ring, and is imprisoned by the magistrate. </quote> In this
                            case the use of the word <hi rend="italic">caught</hi> is sufficient
                            proof that the word steel was only intended by the law in the sense of a
                            weapon of offence. </p>

                    <div n="9" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> But just as the advocate who rests his case on the intention of the law
                            must wherever possible impugn the letter of the law, so he who defends
                            the letter of the law must also seek to gain support from the intention.
                            Again, in cases concerned with wills it sometimes happens that the
                            intention of the testator is clear, though it has not been expressed in
                            writing: an example of this occurs in the trial of Curius, which gave
                            rise to the well-known argument between Lucius Crassus and Scaevola.

                            property. Who could doubt that the intention of the testator was that
                            the same man should inherit in the event of the son not being born who
                            would have inherited in the event of his death? But he had not written

                            recently. A man who had made a bequest of 5000 sesterces, on altering
                            his will erased the word <hi rend="italic">sesterces</hi> and inserted

                            For all writers of text-books are agreed that in such cases there are
                            two <hi rend="italic">bases</hi> involving the letter and the intention
                            of the law respectively. This view is justified by the fact that, when
                            one law contradicts another, both parties attack the letter and raise
                            the question of intention, while the point in dispute, as regards each
                            law, is whether we should be guided by it at all. </p>

                        <p> But it is clear to everybody that one law cannot contradict another in
                            principle (since if there were two different principles, one law would
                            cancel the other), and that the laws in question are brought into
                            collision purely by the accidents of chance. When two laws clash, they
                            may be of a similar nature, as for instance if we have to compare two
                            cases in which a tyrannicide and a brave man are given the choice of
                            their reward, both being granted the privilege of choosing whatever they
                            desire. In such a case we compare the deserts of the claimants, the

                            arguments may be brought against the letter of the law restricting the
                            movements of the magistrate: for example, a fire may have broken out in
                            the citadel, or a sally against the enemy may have been necessary. </p>

                            contravention, as for example in the case of the hero and the deserter

                            still have another choice left open to him. It is, however, of the
                            utmost importance to consider which course is best from the point of
                            view of morality and justice, a problem for the solution of which no

                                she refused. The husband hung himself. The woman is accused of

                            making them the subject for controversial themes, as, for example, in
                            the notorious case of the <foreign xml:lang="grc">αὐλητρίς,</foreign>
                            when the question is whether it is a hall which has fallen down three

                        <p> Consequently, it has been held that those who have exercised the
                            greatest care in writing text-books of rhetoric have been the furthest
                            removed from genuine eloquence. Still, it is absolutely necessary to
                            point out to beginners the road which they should follow, though this
                            road must be smooth and easy not merely to enter, but to indicate.
                            Consequently, our skilful instructor should select all <pb n="v7-9 p.179"/> that is best in the various writers on the subject
                            and content himself for the moment with imparting those precepts of
                            which he approves, without wasting time over the refutation of those
                            which he does not approve. For thus your pupils will follow where you
                            lead. </p>

                            to time to teach them what is actually the best. It is true that writers
                            on rhetoric have, by the pertinacity with which they have defended their
                            opinions, made the principles of the science which they profess somewhat
                            complicated; but these principles are in reality neither obscure nor

                            virtue. I wished also to show that its subject matter consists of

                            circumstances of time and place; further, that whatever our subject

                            merely the acts actually performed by the person of whom we were
                            speaking, but what happened after his death. This task I showed to be

                            emphasised the importance of considering who it is that is speaking,
                            before whom he is speaking, and what he says. As regards forensic cases,
                            I demonstrated that some turn on one point of dispute, others on
                            several, and <pb n="v7-9 p.183"/> that whereas in some cases it is the

                            is of two kinds, since we may either deny that the act was committed or

                            eloquent speakers, and holds that, while to be a good speaker it is
                            sufficient to say what is necessary, only the really eloquent speaker
                            can do this in ornate and appropriate language. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            extreme difficulty of acquisition. Again, Cicero <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Cic. <hi rend="italic">Or.</hi> xiv. 44;

                            consequently it was on the rules for the cultivation of eloquence that

                            of all that the speaker has conceived in his mind, and without this

                            idiomatic and correct speech. But there my remarks were restricted to
                            the prevention of positive faults, and it is well that I should now
                            point out that our words should have nothing provincial or foreign about

                            the story of the old woman at Athens, who, when Theophrastus, a man of
                            no mean eloquence, used one solitary word in an affected way,
                            immediately said that he was a foreigner, and on being asked how she
                            detected it, replied that his language was too Attic for Athens. Again

                            For example, the word <hi rend="italic">vertex</hi> means a whirl of
                            water, or of anything else that is whirled in a like manner: then, owing
                            to the fashion of coiling the hair, it comes to mean the top of the
                            head, while finally, from this sense it derives the meaning of the
                            highest point of a mountain. All these things may correctly be called
                                <hi rend="italic">vertices,</hi> but the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> use of the term is the first. So, too, <hi rend="italic">solea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tuidus</hi>

                            is common to a number of things may be applied in a <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> or special sense to some one of them. Thus we use <hi rend="italic">urbs</hi> in the special sense of Rome, <hi rend="italic">venales</hi> in the special sense of newly-purchased
                            slaves, and <hi rend="italic">Corinthia</hi> in the special sense of
                            bronzes, although there are other cities besides Rome, and many other
                            things which may be styled <hi rend="italic">venales</hi> besides
                            slaves, and gold and silver are found at Corinth as well as bronze. But
                            the use of such terms implies no special excellence in an orator. </p>

                            things are best described by words that are actually harsh to the ear.
                            But as a general rule it may be laid down that the best words,
                            considered individually, are those which are fullest or most agreeable
                            in sound. Again, elegant words are always to be preferred to those which
                            are coarse, and there is no room for low words in the speech of a
                            cultivated man. </p>

                        <p> The choice of striking or sublime words will be determined by the matter
                            in hand; for a word that in one context is magnificent may be turgid in
                            another, and words which are all too mean to describe great things may
                            be suitable enough when applied to subjects of less importance. And just
                            as a mean word embedded in a brilliant passage attracts special
                            attention, like a spot on a bright surface, so if our style be of a
                            plain character, sublime and brilliant words will seem incongruous and

                            the Greeks did not hesitate to coin nouns to represent certain sounds
                            and emotions, and in truth they were taking no greater liberty than was

                            austere language, at length or with conciseness, with gentleness or

                            an obscene suggestion. For example, in the phrase <hi rend="italic">cum

                            letter of the first syllable, which cannot be pronounced without closing
                            the lips, will force us either to pause in a most unbecoming manner, or
                            by assimilation to the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> which follows <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                        <p> The ornate is something that goes beyond what is merely lucid and
                            acceptable. It consists firstly in forming a clear conception of what we
                            wish to say, secondly in giving this adequate expression, and thirdly in
                            lending it additional brilliance, a process which may correctly be
                            termed embellishment. Consequently we must place among ornaments that

                            vivid illustration, or, as some prefer to call it, representation, is

                            does not assert itself as it should, if its appeal is merely to the
                            hearing, and if the judge merely feels that the facts on which he has to
                            give his decision are being narrated to him, and not displayed in their

                            found in the actual word employed to describe a thing. For example, we

                                strong passions for playing the harlot, would this be a reason for
                                my regarding a man who was somewhat free in his method of saluting

                            consideration for the present. I would proceed to the immediate
                            discussion of this subject but for the fact that others have given
                            separate treatment to this form of artifice, [which employs words not in
                            their literal, but in a metaphorical sense <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See ch. vi.</note> ]. I shall therefore at this
                            point indulge a desire now almost universal, and discuss a form of
                            ornament which many regard as the chief, nay, almost the sole adornment
                            of oratory. </p>

                        <p>V. When the ancients used the word <hi rend="italic">sententia,</hi> they meant a feeling, or opinion. The word is
                            frequently used in this sense by orators, and traces of this meaning are
                            still found even in the speech of every day. For when we are going to
                            take an oath we use the phrase <hi rend="italic">ex animi nostri
                                sententia (in</hi> accordance with what we hold is the solemn
                            truth), and when we offer congratulations, we say that we do so <hi rend="italic">ex sententia</hi> (with all our heart). The ancients,
                            indeed, often expressed the same meaning by saying that they uttered
                            their <hi rend="italic">sensa;</hi> for they regarded <hi rend="italic">senses</hi> as referring merely to the senses of the body. </p>

                            our own. Accordingly, I think that I ought to say something of the
                            various forms which such reflexions may tale and the manner in which

                            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">γνώμη</foreign> by the Greeks. Both the
                            Greek and the Latin names are derived from the fact that such utterances
                            resemble the decrees or resolutions of public bodies. The term, however,
                            is of wide application (indeed, such reflexions may be deserving of
                            praise even when they have no reference to any special context), and is
                            used in various ways. Sometimes it refers merely to things, as in the
                            sentence: <quote> There is nothing that wins the affections of the

                            personal reference, as in the following utterance of Domitius Afer:

                            the play upon words is combined with a false comparison. When I was a

                            provide an occasion for his epigram), cry: <quote>Unhappiest of women,

                            wit. Take, for instance, the exclamation from the scholastic theme,
                            where a man, after being ruined by the barrenness of his land, is
                            shipwrecked and hangs himself: <quote>Let him whom neither earth nor sea

                                deserves such drink.</quote> Or again, take this passage from the
                            theme of the luxurious man who is alleged to have pretended to starve

                            discuss a point of more importance. Rhetoricians are divided in opinion
                            on this subject: some devote practically all their efforts to the

                            throw objects into relief, and consequently artists who include a number
                            of objects in the same design separate them by intervals sufficient to
                            prevent one casting a shadow on the other. Further, </p>

                            secure elevation by frequent small efforts, it merely produces an uneven
                            and broken surface which fails to win the admiration due to outstanding
                            objects and lacks the charm that may be found in a smooth surface. </p>

                            Demosthenes frequently employed methods that were known to none before
                            him. How can we give our approval to Cicero, if we think that no change
                            should be made from the methods of Cato and the Gracchi? And yet before
                            the Gracchi and Cato the style of oratory was simpler still. </p>

                            see the whole body full of eyes, for fear that it might cripple the

                            it is often employed unconsciously or by uneducated persons, but it is
                            in itself so attractive and elegant that however distinguished the

                            and finally succeeds in accomplishing the supremely difficult task of
                            providing a name for everything. A noun or a verb is transferred from
                            the place to which it properly belongs to another where there is either
                            no <hi rend="italic">literal</hi> term or the <hi rend="italic">transferred</hi> is better than the <hi rend="italic">literal.</hi>

                            inappropriate. Anyone who realises that these are faults, will be able

                        <pb n="v7-9 p.325"/> is clearly an ornament. Poets
                            employ it with special frequency and freedom, since for them it is
                            sufficient that the epithet should suit the word to which it is applied:
                            consequently we shall not blame them when they speak of <quote>white

                            But in oratory an epithet is redundant unless it has some point. Now it
                            will only have point when it adds something to the meaning, as for
                            instance in the following: <quote>O abominable crime, O hideous

                            nature of this form of embellishment is such that, while style is bare
                            and inelegant without any epithets at all, it is overloaded when a large
                            number are employed. </p>

                            None the less, not merely single epithets are employed, but we may find
                            a number of them together, as in the following passage from Virgil:

                            Oratory makes frequent use of such allegory, but generally with this
                            modification, that there is an admixture of plain speaking. We get
                            allegory pure and unadulterated in the following passage of Cicero:
                                <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">From an unknown

                        <p> The following is an example of the commonest type, namely, the mixed

                        <quote> I always thought that Milo

                            however, converted it into a mixed allegory. In this type of allegory
                            the ornamental element is provided by the metaphorical words and the
                            meaning is indicated by those which are used literally. </p>

                                with their wild ebb and flow? The passing of one day, or the
                                interval of a single night, will often throw everything into
                                confusion, and one little breath of rumour will sometimes turn the
                                whole trend of opinion. <milestone n="50" unit="section"/>

                            For it is all-important to follow the principle illustrated by this

                        <p> For the rest, allegory is often used by men of little ability and in the

                            allegorical, although they do not strike the attention: for it is
                            novelty and change that please in oratory, and what is unexpected always
                            gives special delight. Consequently we have thrown all restraint to the
                            wind in such matters, and have destroyed the charm of language by the
                            extravagant efforts which we have made to attain it. </p>

                        <p> Illustrative examples also involve allegory if not preceded by an
                            explanation; for there are numbers of sayings available for use like the

                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The allusion must be to the fact that Dionysius
                                II, tyrant of Syracuse, on his expulsion from the throne, migrated
                                to Corinth and set up as a schoolmaster. Its application is
                                uncertain, but it would obviously be a way of saying <quote>How are

                            view of the fact that lucidity is a virtue; nevertheless they are used
                            by poets, as, for example, by Virgil <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                        <pb n="v7-9 p.351"/> is applied to the transference of expressions from
                            their natural and principal signification to another, with a view to the
                            embellishment of style or, as the majority of grammarians define it, the
                            transference of words and phrases from the place which is strictly
                            theirs to another to which they do not properly belong. A <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi> on the other hand, as is clear from the
                            name itself, is the term employed when we give our language a

                            either with words or things. <hi rend="italic">Onomatopoea</hi> is the
                            creation of a word and therefore involves substitution for the words

                            place of one. The <hi rend="italic">epithet</hi> as a rule involves an

                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">VIII. vi. 29 and 46.</note> and consequently
                            becomes a <hi rend="italic">trope</hi> on account of this affinity. <hi rend="italic">Hyperbaton</hi> is a change of order and for this

                            and <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> are often combined in the expression

                            what is meant by a <hi rend="italic">figure.</hi> For the term is used
                            in two senses. In the first it is applied to any form in which thought

                        <p> In the second and special sense, in which it is called a <hi rend="italic">schema,</hi> it means a rational change in meaning or
                            language from the ordinary and simple form, that is to say, a change
                            analogous to that involved by sitting, lying down on something or
                            looking back. Consequently when a student tends <pb n="v7-9 p.355"/> to
                            continuous or at any rate excessive use of the same cases, tenses,
                            rhythms or even feet, we are in the habit of instructing him to vary his
                                <hi rend="italic">figures</hi> with a view to the avoidance of

                            If we are content with this view, there is good reason for the opinion
                            expressed by Apollodorus (if we may trust the statement of Caecilius on
                            this point) to the effect that he found the rules laid down in this

                                above), exculpation, conciliation, personal attacks, wishes and
                                execrations are all of value. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> The

                                employed for the adornment of our speech. As regards diction, this
                                may either be employed like weapons for menace and attack, or
                                handled merely for the purpose of display. For example, sometimes
                                the repetition of words will produce an impression of force, at
                                other times of grace. Again, slight changes and alterations may be
                                made in words, the same word may be repeated sometimes at the
                                beginning of a sentence and sometimes at the end, or the sentence
                                may be made to open and close with the same phrase. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This appears to be the

                                stand out conspicuously in the midst of other ornaments. <milestone n="38" unit="section"/> The principle governing the use of
                                embellishments and decorations of style is the same: words may be

                                the same inflexion or termination or be placed in various
                                antitheses, our language may rise by gradations to a climax, or a
                                number of words may be placed together in asyndeton without
                                connecting particles. Or we may omit something, while making clear
                                the reason for such omission, or correct ourselves with apparent
                                censure of our carelessness, may utter exclamations of admiration or
                                grief, or introduce the same word repeatedly in different cases.
                                    <milestone n="40" unit="section"/> The ornaments of thought are,
                                however, more important. They are so frequently employed by
                                Demosthenes that some critics have held that it is in them that the
                                chief beauty of his style resides. And in truth there is hardly a
                                topic in his speeches which is not distinguished by some artificial
                                treatment of the thought, and it must be admitted that speaking
                                involves the embellishment of all, or at any rate most of our
                                thoughts with some form of ornament. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> As you, Brutus, have such an admirable
                                knowledge of all these methods, it would be waste of time for me to
                                cite all their names or to give illustrations. I shall therefore
                                content myself merely with indicating this topic. Our ideal orator
                                then will speak in such a manner that he will cast the same thought
                                into a number of different forms, will dwell on one point and linger
                                over the same idea. <milestone n="42" unit="section"/> he will often
                                attenuate some one point or deride his opponent, will diverge from

                                intends to say, after completing his argument will give a brief
                                summary, will <pb n="v7-9 p.373"/> recall himself to the point which
                                he has left, repeat what he has said, complete his proof by a formal
                                conclusion, embarrass his opponent by asking questions or answer
                                himself in reply to imaginary questions; <milestone n="43" unit="section"/> will desire his words to be taken in a
                                different sense from their literal meaning, will hesitate what
                                argument or form of statement to prefer, will classify and divide,
                                will deliberately omit and ignore some point, and defend himself by
                                anticipation; will transfer the blame of some charge brought against
                                him to his opponent, will often take his audience, and sometimes
                                even his opponent into consultation, <milestone n="44" unit="section"/> will describe the character and talk of
                                particular persons, will put words into the mouths of inanimate
                                objects, divert the minds of the audience from the point at issue,
                                often move them to merriment or laughter, anticipate objections,
                                introduce comparisons, cite precedents, assign and distribute
                                different sentiments to different persons, silence interrupters,
                                assert that there are certain things of which he prefers not to
                                speak, warn his audience to be on their guard against certain
                                things, or venture on a certain licence of speech. Again, he will
                                wax angry, sometimes indulge in rebuke, entreaty or supplication,
                                will clear away unfavourable impressions, swerve a little from his
                                point, utter wishes or execrations, or address his audience in terms
                                of familiar intimacy. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> There are
                                also other virtues at which he should aim, such as brevity, if his
                                theme demands it, while he will often set forth topics in such vivid
                                language as almost to present them to the very eyes of his audience,
                                or will exaggerate his subject beyond the bounds of possibility. His
                                meaning will frequently be deeper than his words seem to <pb n="v7-9 p.375"/> indicate, his tone will often be cheerful, and
                                he will often mimic life and character. In fact, as regards this
                                department of oratory, of which I have given you the substance, lie

                            amplification and its opposite? of which the first requires the gift of
                            signifying more than we say, that is <hi rend="italic">emphasis,</hi>
                            together with exaggeration and overstatement of the truth, while the
                            latter requires the power to diminish and palliate. What scope is there
                            for the stronger emotions if the orator is not allowed to give free rein
                                <pb n="v7-9 p.377"/> to his speech, to flame out in anger, to
                            reproach, to wish or execrate? Or for the milder emotions without the

                            minds of the audience by repetition, and another by dwelling on it, how
                            to digress from and return to his theme, to divert the blame from
                            himself and transfer it to another, or to decide what points to omit and
                            what to ignore as negligible? It is qualities such as these that give
                            life and vigour to oratory; without them it lies torpid like a body

                            these qualities are as a rule open and direct, manifesting themselves

                        <p> Similar, if not identical with this figure is another, which is much in
                            vogue at the present time. For I must now proceed to the discussion of a
                            class of figure which is of the commonest occurrence and on which I
                            think I shall be expected to make some comment. It is one whereby we
                            excite some suspicion to indicate that our meaning is other than our
                            words would seem to imply; but our meaning is not in this case contrary
                            to that which we express, as is the case in <hi rend="italic">ironq,</hi> but rather a hidden meaning which is left to the hearer
                            to discover. As I have already pointed out, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">IX. i. 14.</note> modern rhetoricians
                            practically restrict the name of <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> to this
                            device, from the use of which <hi rend="italic">figured</hi>
                            controversial themes derive their name. </p>

                        <p> This class of figure may be employed under three conditions: first, if
                            it is unsafe to speak openly; secondly, if it is unseemly to speak
                            openly; and thirdly, when it is employed solely with a view to the
                            elegance of what we say, and gives greater pleasure by reason of the
                            novelty and variety thus introduced than if our meaning had been
                            expressed in straightforward language. </p>

                        <p> The first of the three is of common occurrence in the schools, where we
                            imagine conditions laid down by tyrants on abdication and decrees passed
                            by the senate after a civil war, and it is a capital offence to accuse a
                            person with what is past, what is not <pb n="v7-9 p.417"/> expedient in
                            the courts being actually prohibited in the schools. But the conditions
                            governing the employment of figures differ in the two cases. For we may
                            speak against the tyrants in question as openly as we please without
                            loss of effect, provided always that what we say is susceptible of a
                            different interpretation, since it is only danger to ourselves, and not
                            offence to them, that we have to avoid. </p>

                            hand, the actual business of the courts has never yet involved such
                            necessity for silence, though at times they require something not unlike
                            it, which is much more embarrassing for the speaker, as, for example,
                            when he is hampered by the existence of powerful personages, whom he
                            must censure if he is to prove his case. </p>

                            since the actual manner in which offence is given is a matter of
                            indifference, and if a figure is perfectly obvious, it ceases to be a
                            figure. Therefore such devices are absolutely repudiated by some
                            authorities, whether the meaning of the figure be intelligible or not.

                            other means: I have even come across a much rarer thing, namely, a case
                            which could only be proved by recourse to such devices. I was defending
                            a woman who was alleged to have forged her husband's will, and the heirs
                            were stated to have given a bond <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The bond was to the effect that they would make
                                over the property to the wife; the existence of such a bond proved
                                the wife innocent, since it was a virtual confirmation of the will,
                                of which it showed the husband to have cognisance. But the bond was
                                not valid in the eye of the law and such <hi rend="italic">tacita
                                    fideicommissa</hi> were illegal, since the wife could not
                                inherit; consequently the admission of the existence of the bond
                                would have involved the loss of the inheritance, which on
                                information being laid (cp. <hi rend="italic">delatores</hi> ) would
                                have lapsed to the state. <hi rend="italic">Caput</hi> is the civil
                                status of the wife. With regard to <hi rend="italic">dicebantur,</hi> the writing is careless, as it suggests that
                                the statement was made by the prosecution, which was, of course, not

                            transferred to her by a secret conveyance in trust. Now it was easy for
                            me to secure the woman's acquittal, by openly mentioning the existence
                            of the bond; but this would have involved her loss of the inheritance. I
                            had, therefore, to plead in such a way that the judges should understand
                            that the bond had actually been given, but that informers might be
                            unable to avail themselves of any statement of mine to that effect. And

                            against his wife, should by his defence confirm the charge which he is
                            required to refute? If such speakers had only placed themselves in the

                            they would have been to put up with pleading on such lines, more
                            especially in cases where the most abominable crimes were insinuated
                            against parents. </p>

                            more time to considering the practice of the schools. For it is in the

                                accuser shall choose what reward he pleases. A certain man has
                                secured the condemnation of his father and demands as his reward
                                that he should not be tortured. The father opposes his choice.

                                his son, he deserted on being compelled to go into the fight. The
                                son, who had borne himself like a hero in the same battle, asks for
                                his father's pardon as a reward. The father opposes his choice.

                                that he would be condemned. His father gave evidence in his defence,
                                stating that the murder had been committed on his orders. The son
                                was acquitted, but disinherited by the <pb n="v7-9 p.431"/> father.

                            cannot openly withdraw the evidence that he gave in the first trial, and

                            to indicate one thing by allusion to another; take the case where a
                            rival candidate speaks against an ex-tyrant who had abdicated on
                            condition of his receiving an amnesty <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> An example of this theme is preserved in the
                                elder Seneca, Excerpt. controv. 5, 8. One candidate is permitted to
                                speak against another. A tyrant has abdicated on condition of an
                                amnesty and that any one who charged him with having been a tyrant
                                should be liable to capital punishment. The ex-tyrant stands for a
                                magistracy. The rival candidate speaks against him. The irony is in
                                the last sentence. </note> : <quote> I am not permitted to speak

                        <p> Another common device is to introduce an oath, like the speaker who, in

                            becoming to a self-respecting man. Seneca made a neat comment to this
                            effect when he said that oaths were for the witness and not for the
                            advocate. Again, the advocate who drags in an oath merely for the sake
                            of some trivial rhetorical effect, does not deserve much credit, unless

                            always been liable to change and are continually in process of change in
                            accordance with the variations of usage. Consequently when we compare
                            the language of our ancestors with our own, we find that practically
                            everything we say nowadays is <hi rend="italic">figurative.</hi> For
                            example, we say <hi rend="italic">invidere hac re</hi> for to
                                <quote>grudge a thing,</quote> instead of <hi rend="italic">hanc
                                rem,</hi> which was the idiom of all the ancients, more especially
                            Cicero, and <hi rend="italic">incumbere illi</hi> (to lean upon him) for
                                <hi rend="italic">incumbere in ilium, plenum vino</hi> (full of
                            wine) for <hi rend="italic">plenum vini,</hi> and <hi rend="italic">huic
                                adulari</hi> (to flatter him) for <hi rend="italic">hunc
                                adulari.</hi> I might quote a thousand other examples, and only wish
                            I could say that the changes were not often changes for the worse. </p>

                        <p> But to proceed, <hi rend="italic">figures of speech</hi> fall into two
                            main classes. One is defined as the form of language, while the other is
                            mainly to be sought in the arrangement of words. Both are equally
                            applicable in oratory, but we may style the former rather more
                            grammatical and the latter more rhetorical. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> These grammatical figures would not be styled
                                    <quote>figures of speech</quote> in English. <quote>Figures of
                                    language</quote> would perhaps be more comprehensive, but
                                    <quote>figures of speech</quote> is the translation and direct
                                descendant of the original Greek <foreign xml:lang="grc">σχήματα
                                    λέξεως</foreign> and has therefore been used throughout. </note>
                            The former originates from the same sources as errors of language. For
                            every <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> of this kind would be an error, if
                            it were accidental and not deliberate. </p>

                        <p> But as a rule such <hi rend="italic">figures</hi> are defended by
                            authority, age and usage, and not infrequently by some reason as well.
                            Consequently, although they involve a divergence from direct and simple
                            language, they are to be regarded as excellences, provided always that
                            they have some praiseworthy precedent to follow. They have one special
                            merit, that they relieve the tedium of everyday stereotyped speech and
                            save us from commonplace language. </p>

                            attractions. If, on the other hand, he strains after them overmuch, he
                            will lose that very charm of variety which they confer. Some figures,
                            however, are so generally accepted that they have almost ceased to be
                            regarded as figures: consequently however frequently they may be used,
                            they will make less impression on the ear, just because it has become

                            case of <hi rend="italic">vapulo</hi> (am beaten). Consequently the
                            interchange of the two forms is of common occurrence, and in many cases
                            either form can be used: for example, we may say <hi rend="italic">luxuriatur</hi> or <hi rend="italic">luxuriat</hi> (luxuriate), <hi rend="italic">fluctuatur</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fluctuat</hi>

                            force to the thought as well. The first figure of this class which calls

                            correspondence between the beginnings: <quote> I would have faced every
                                kind of danger; I would have exposed myself to treacherous attacks;
                                I would have delivered myself over to public hatred. </quote>

                            of conclusions is provided by another passage in the same speech which
                            follows close on that just cited: <quote>For you have decided; you have

                            correct. For the words are differentiated, but their meaning is
                            identical. Sometimes, again, words of the same meaning are grouped
                            together. For instance, <quote> Since this is so, Catiline, proceed on
                                the path which you have entered; depart from the city, it is high

                        <p> There is a third class of <hi rend="italic">figures</hi> which attracts
                            the ear of the audience and excites their attention by some resemblance,
                            equality or contrast of words. To this class belongs <hi rend="italic">paronomasia,</hi> which we call <hi rend="italic">adnominatio.</hi>

                            different cases. Take the following passage from Domitius Afer's defence

                        <p> The old orators were at great pains to achieve elegance in the use of
                            words similar or opposite in sound. Gorgias carried the practice to an
                            extravagant pitch, while Isocrates, at any rate in his early days, was
                            much addicted to it. Even Cicero delighted in it, but showed some
                            restraint in the employment of a device which is not unattractive save
                            when carried to excess, and, further, by the weight of his thought lent
                            dignity to what would otherwise have been mere trivialities. For in
                            itself this artifice is a flat and foolish affectation, but when it goes
                            hand in hand with vigour of thought, it gives the impression of natural
                            charm, which the speaker has not had to go far to find. </p>

                            discussion of the topic: I allude to writers such as Caecilius,
                            Dionysius, Rutilius, Cornificius, Visellius and not a few others,
                            although there are living authors who will be no less famous than they.

                            while his flow, in my opinion, is always gentle, his <pb n="v7-9 p.517"/> dialect has such a sweetness of its own that it even seems to contain

                            on the other hand they have not the flow or the compactness of other
                            styles, nor does one word lead up so inexorably to another, the
                            structural cohesion being loose rather than non-existent. </p>

                            that our style does not diminish in force through the fact that a weaker
                            word is made to follow a stronger: as, for example, if after calling a
                            man a despoiler of temples we were to speak of him as a thief, or after
                            styling him a highwayman were to dub him an insolent fellow. For
                            sentences should rise and grow in force: of this an excellent example is
                            provided by Cicero, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                           <hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi> II. xxv. 63. </note> where he says,

                                would do credit to a prizefighter, in every limb of your body

                            scarcely have gone on to speak of his lungs and throat without an
                            anticlimax. There is also another species of order which may be entitled
                            natural, as for example when we speak of <quote>men and

                            the case in the best authors of Rome and Greece. Of course, in every

                            there is good reason for the view that all the followers of Isocrates
                            and more especially Theopompus pay accessive attention to the avoidance
                            of this detect. </p>

                            it should not lack rhythm, a deficiency which would stamp the author as

                            belong if the consonants <hi rend="italic">st</hi> were removed? As it
                            is, it lends one time-length to the preceding syllable, and subtracts
                            one from that which follows. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                                This theory involves the allotment of a time-value to consonants:
                                    <hi rend="italic">gres</hi> gives the time-value of <hi rend="italic">gr</hi> to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and itself
                                borrows an equivalent time-value from <hi rend="italic">st.</hi>
                                This view is more explicitly expressed by the fifth-century
                                grammarian Pompeius (112. 26k), who allots the value of half a
                                time-length to each consonant. Therefore to ă (= one time-length)
                                are added the two half time-lengths represented by <hi rend="italic">gr</hi> (see Lindsay, <hi rend="italic">Lat. Language,</hi> p.
                                129). </note> Thus two syllables which are naturally short have

                            superior kindred. The nature of letters and syllables cannot be changed,
                            but their adaptability to each other is a consideration of no small
                            importance. Long syllables, as I have said, <pb n="v7-9 p.559"/> carry
                            the greater dignity and weight, while short syllables create an
                            impression of speed: if the latter are intermixed with a few long
                            syllables, their gait will be a run, but a gallop if they are
                            continuous. </p>

                        <p> When a short syllable is followed by a long the effect is one of

                            impression and suggests descent. It is therefore best to begin with long
                            syllables, though at times it may be correct to begin with short, as in

                            that a concluding short syllable is usually regarded as equivalent to a
                            long, because the time-length which it lacks appears to be supplied from

                            yet somehow or other one gives the impression of sitting down and the
                            other of a simple halt. This fact has led some critics to allow three
                            timebeats for a final long syllable, adding the extra <pb n="v7-9 p.561"/> time-length which a short syllable derives from its position at the
                            end of a sentence to the long syllable as well. And it not merely makes
                            a difference with what foot a sentence ends, but the penultimate foot is

                            was created by the instinctive feeling of the ear for quantity and the
                            observation of time and rhythm, while the discovery of feet came later.
                            Consequently assiduous practice in writing will be sufficient to enable
                            us to produce similar rhythmical effects when speaking extempore. </p>

                        <p> Further it is not so important for us to consider the actual feet as the
                                <pb n="v7-9 p.573"/> general rhythmical effect of the period, just
                            as the poet in writing a verse considers the metre as a whole, and does
                            not concentrate his attention on the six or five individual feet that
                            constitute the verse. For poetry originated before the laws which govern
                            it, a fact which explains Ennius' statement <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Enn. <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> 213. </note>

                            held by versification in poetry. The best judge as to rhythm is the ear,
                            which appreciates fullness of rhythm or feels the lack of it, is
                            offended by harshness, soothed by smooth and excited by impetuous
                            movement, and approves stability, while it detects limping measures and
                            rejects those that are excessive and extravagant. It is for this reason
                            that those who have received a thorough training understand the theory

                            begun, produces a harsh rhythm, it must be changed. But is it possible
                            to lay down any definite rule as to what the change of case, tense or
                            mood should be? It is often possible to help out the rhythm when it is

                            consideration if he is to do this with success. The one is concerned
                            with feet, the other with the general rhythm of the period which is
                            produced by their combination. I will deal with the latter first. We

                            sonority as well. On the other hand, passages of an opposite character,
                            such as those in which we argue, distinguish, jest or use language
                            approximating to colloquial speech, are better served by short

                            excellent, but I refuse to admit that the form of rhythmical structure
                            which it exemplifies should be forced on all <hi rend="italic">exordia.</hi> For there are various ways in which the <pb n="v7-9 p.583"/> judge's mind may be prepared for what is to come:
                            at times we appeal for pity, at others take up a modest attitude, while
                            we may assume an air of energy or dignity, flatter our audience, attempt
                            to alter their opinions and exhort them to give us their best attention,
                            according as the situation may demand. And as all these methods are
                            different by nature, so each requires a different rhythmical treatment.
                            Did Cicero employ similar rhythms in his <hi rend="italic">exordia</hi>

                            kinds of feet should, as far as possible, be intermixed. For while the
                            style of this portion of our speech is generally marked by restraint of
                            language, there are occasions when it is called upon to soar to greater

                            effect of an ascent, as they climb and swell from short to long, a fact
                            which renders them superior to the <hi rend="italic">choreus,</hi> which

                            rhythmical structure which produces a particularly stately effect: I do

                            it is obvious that it was with this that the art of oratory began, and
                            that the power of imitation comes next, and third and last diligent

                            beginning, the points which come first in time will, as our training
                            proceeds, become of quite trivial importance. Now we have reached a
                            stage in our enquiry where we are no longer considering the preliminary
                            training of our orator; for I think the instructions already given
                            should suffice for that; they are in any case as good as I could make
                            them. Our present task is to consider how our athlete who has learnt all

                            practice for the contests in which he will have to engage. Consequently,
                            we must assume that our student has learned how to conceive and dispose
                            his subject matter and understands how to choose and arrange his words,
                            and must proceed to instruct him how to make the best and readiest use
                            of the knowledge which he has acquired. </p>

                            resources, to be employed whenever they may be required. The resources
                            of which I speak consist in a copious supply of words and matter. </p>

                            all and every case. Now, if there were special <pb n="v10-12 p.7"/> words
                            adapted to each individual thing, they would require less care, since
                            they would automatically be suggested by the matter in hand. But since
                            some words are more literal, more ornate, more significant or euphonious
                            than others, our orator must not merely be acquainted with all of them,
                            but must have them at his fingers' ends and before his very eyes, so
                            that when they present themselves for his critical selection, he will

                        <p> I know that some speakers make a practice of learning lists of synonyms

                            once present itself to them, and that if, after using one word, they
                            find that it is wanted again after a brief interval, they may be able to
                            select another word with the same meaning and so avoid the necessity of
                            repetition. But this practice is childish and involves thankless labour,
                            while it is really of very little use, as it merely results in the
                            assembly of a disorderly crowd of words, for the speaker to snatch the

                            by which things are to be called, but when each particular word is most

                            require low and common words, while those which would seem coarse if

                            the rules which are taught in the schools, so long as the student has
                            reached a stage when he can appreciate such examples without the
                            assistance of a teacher, and can rely on his own powers to imitate them.
                            And the reason is this, that the professor of rhetoric lays down rules,
                            while the orator gives a practical demonstration. </p>

                            We must note their procedure in the exordium, the method and variety of
                            their statement of facts, the power displayed in proof and refutation,
                            the skill revealed in their appeal to every kind of emotion, and the

                            deliberately courted. If we have thoroughly appreciated all these

                            nephew. He once noticed that Secundus, who was still a student, was
                            looking depressed, and asked him the meaning of his frowns. The youth

                            to write, with the result that he was not only vexed over his immediate
                            difficulty, but had lost all hope of future success. Florus smiled and
                            said, <quote>Do you really want to speak better than you

                            permit. For to make any real advance we need study, not selfaccusation.
                            And it is not merely practice that will enable us to write at greater

                            delays the hand and interrupts the stream of thought owing to the
                            frequency with which the pen has to be supplied with ink. </p>

                            may most easily be derived. Our earlier orators thought highly of

                        <p> The purpose of this form of exercise is obvious. For Greek authors are
                            conspicuous for the variety of their matter, and there is much art in

                            the original in the expression of the same thoughts. Consequently, I
                            disagree with those who forbid the student to parahrase speeches of our
                            own orators, on the ground that, since all the best expressions have
                            already been appropriated, whatever we express differently must
                            necessarily be a change for the worse. For it is always possible that we
                            may discover expressions which are an improvement on those which have
                            already been used, and nature did not make eloquence such a poor and
                            starveling thing, that there should be only one adequate expression for

                            so that when a thing has once been said, it is impossible to say
                            anything else on the same theme. Why, even if it be granted that no new
                            expression we discover can be better than or even equal to the old, it

                            when, at the height of his fame in the schools, he was called upon to
                            plead a case in the forum, he put forward the most earnest request that
                            the court should be transferred to some public hall. He was so
                            unaccustomed to speak in the open air that all his eloquence seemed to
                            reside within the compass of a <pb n="v10-12 p.125"/> roof and four walls.

                            premeditation, which itself derives force from the practice of writing
                            and forms an intermediate stage between the labours of the pen and the

                            is not more frequently of use than either. For there are places and

                            abundance for premeditation. For <pb n="v10-12 p.129"/> but a few hours'
                            thought will suffice to cover all the points even of cases of
                            importance; if we wake at night, the very darkness will assist us, while
                            even in the midst of legal proceedings our mind will find some vacant

                            achievement, but will also set the words which we are going to use in
                            their proper order, and bring the general texture of our speech to such
                            a stage of completion that nothing further is required beyond the
                            finishing touches. And as a rule the memory is more retentive of
                            thoughts when the attention has not been relaxed by the fancied security
                            which results from committing them to writing. But the concentration

                            speaking, we must not cling superstitiously to our premeditated scheme.
                            For premeditation is not so accurate as to leave no room for happy
                            inspiration: even when writing we often insert thoughts which occur to
                            us on the spur of the moment. Consequently this form of preparation must
                            be conceived on such lines that we shall find no difficulty either in
                            departing from it or returning to it at will. </p>

                        <p> For, although it is essential to bring with us into court a supply of
                            eloquence which has been prepared in advance in the study and on which
                            we can confidently rely, there is no greater folly than the rejection of
                            the gifts of the moment. Therefore our premeditation should be such that
                            fortune may never be able to fool us, but may, on the contrary, be able
                            to assist us. This end will be obtained by developing the power of
                            memory so that our conceptions may flow from us without fear of
                            disaster, and that we may be enabled to look ahead without anxious
                            backward glances or the feeling that we are absolutely dependent on what
                            we can call to mind. Otherwise I prefer the rashness of improvisation to

                            subject on which we are speaking. And even if we are to rely on our
                            memory and our subject alike, there are more things that may be

                            that even but moderately trained speakers find it easiest to keep the

                            Secondly, the orator must know what to look for in each portion of his
                            case: he must not beat about the bush or allow himself to be thrown off
                            the track by thoughts which suggest themselves from irrelevant quarters,
                            or produce a speech which is a confused mass of incongruities, <pb n="v10-12 p.137"/> owing to his habit of leaping this way and that,

                            individual study. We must acquire a store of the best words and phrases

                            by continuous and conscientious practice in writing, so that even our
                            improvisations may reproduce the tone of our writing, and after writing
                            much, we must give ourselves frequent practice in speaking. </p>

                            frequently happens that he attains a success from improvisation which

                            Whatever we say, under whatever circumstances, should be perfect in its
                            way. As regards writing, this is certainly never more necessary than
                            when we have frequently to speak extempore. For it maintains the
                            solidity of our speech and gives depth to superficial facility. We may
                            compare the practice of husbandmen who cut away the uppermost roots of
                            their vines, which run close to the surface of the soil, that the

                            precision of speech, while speaking will make us write with greater
                            facility. We must write, therefore, whenever possible; if we cannot
                            write, we must meditate: if both are out of the question, we must still
                            speak in such a manner that we shall not seem to be taken unawares nor

                            plead to write out the most necessary portions, more especially the
                            beginnings of their speeches, to cover the remainder of that which they
                            are able to prepare by careful premeditation and to trust to
                            improvisation in emergency, a practice regularly adopted by Cicero, as

                            written it out in full. For reliance on such notes as these makes us
                            careless in learning what we have written and mutilates and deforms our
                            style. For my own part I think that we should never write out anything
                            which we do not intend to commit to memory. For if we do, our thoughts
                            will run back to what we have elaborated in writing and will not permit

                            these two considerations generally go hand in hand. For whatever is
                            becoming is, as a rule, useful, and there is nothing that does more to

                            The wisest of men preferred to sacrifice the remnant of his days rather
                            than to cancel all his past life. And since he was but ill understood by
                            the men of his own day, he reserved his case for the approval of
                            posterity and at the cost of a few last declining years achieved through

                            offered him a written defence, he refused to make use of it, since,
                            though he recognised its excellence, he regarded it as unbecoming to
                            himself. This instance alone shows that the end which the orator must
                            keep in view is not persuasion, but speaking well, since there are
                            occasions when to persuade would be a blot upon his honour. The line
                            adopted by Socrates was useless to secure his acquittal, but was of real

                            namely, to act and speak as befits a man of honour, and it will never at
                            any time beseem any man to speak or act dishonourably. On the other

                            will fall under neither head. In the first place, then, all kinds of
                            boasting are a mistake, above all, it is an error for an orator to
                            praise his own eloquence, and, further, not merely wearies, but in the

                            such an act gives us a consciousness of our <pb n="v10-12 p.165"/>

                            is taken by a feeling of humanity. But the man who exalts himself beyond

                            their own are always liable to this failing), while his superiors laugh
                            at him and the good disapprove. Indeed, as a rule, you will find that
                            arrogance implies a false self-esteem, whereas those who possess true
                            merit find satisfaction enough in the consciousness of possession.
                            Cicero has been severely censured in this connexion, although he was far
                            more given to boasting of his political achievements than of his
                            eloquence, at any rate, in his speeches. </p>

                            Catiline, or was replying to attacks made upon him by those who envied
                            his position; attacks which he was so far unable to withstand that he
                            suffered exile as the penalty for having saved his country.
                            Consequently, we may regard his frequent reference to the deeds
                            accomplished in his consulship as being due quite as much to the
                            necessities of defence as to the promptings of vainglory. </p>

                            of some other character. And yet I am not sure that open boasting is not

                            his <hi rend="italic">ipse dixit</hi> with the veneration accorded by
                            the Pythagoreans to that of their master. But this fault will vary in
                            seriousness according to the character of the orator who uses such

                            and authority of the speaker. But scarcely any orator is possessed of
                            these advantages to such an extent as to exempt him from the duty of
                            tempering such assertions by a certain show of modesty, a remark which
                            also applies to all passages in which the advocate draws any of his
                            arguments from his own person. What could have been more presumptuous
                            than if Cicero had asserted that the fact that a man was the son of a

                            against his mother? And yet sometimes it is absolutely necessary, as,
                            for example, in the case of Cluentius Habitus. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> See <hi rend="italic">pro Clu.</hi> lxi. 169

                            But it is not always desirable to employ the method adopted by Cicero
                            against Sasia, not because he did not make most admirable use of it, but
                            because in such cases it makes the greatest difference what the point
                            may be and what the manner in which the mother seeks to injure her son.

                            with, that were handled by Cicero with consummate skill: in the first
                            place, he does not forget the reverence that is due to parents, and in
                            the second, after a thorough investigation of the history of the crime,
                            he makes it clear that it was not merely right, but a positive necessity

                            becoming for him to say. He therefore made the name of mother cast odium

                            odium which we incur or even transfer it to a different quarter, while
                            if it be obvious that the son is deeply grieved by the situation, it
                            will be believed that he is blameless in the matter and he will even

                        </note> gives an example of such
                            moderation in the way in which he deals with Atratinus in his defence of

                            like a father. For Atratinus was of noble birth and young, and the
                            grievance which led him to bring the accusation was not unreasonable.

                            inevitably involve its destruction. Thus he succeeded in creating the

                        <p>II. Some regard memory as being no more than one of nature's
                            gifts; and this view is no doubt true to a great extent; but, like
                            everything else, memory <pb n="v10-12 p.213"/> may be improved by
                            cultivation. And all the labour of which I have so far spoken will be in
                            vain unless all the other departments be co-ordinated by the animating
                            principle of memory. For our whole education depends upon memory, and we
                            shall receive instruction all in vain if all we hear slips from us,
                            while it is the power of memory alone that brings before us all the
                            store of precedents, laws, rulings, sayings and facts which the orator
                            must possess in abundance and which he must always hold ready for
                            immediate use. Indeed it is not without good reason that memory has been
                            called the treasure-house of eloquence. </p>

                            their minds, but also to be quick to take them in; it is not enough to
                            learn what you have written by dint of repeated reading; it is just as
                            necessary to follow the order both of matter and words when you have
                            merely thought out what you are going to say, while you must also
                            remember what has been said by your opponents, and must not be content
                            merely with refuting their arguments in the order in which they were
                            advanced, but must be in a position to deal with each in its appropriate

                            be considering something else that we are going to say: consequently,
                            since the mind is always looking ahead, it is continually in search of
                            something which is more remote: on the other hand, whatever it
                            discovers, it deposits by some mysterious process in the safe-keeping of
                            memory, which acts as a transmitting agent and hands on to the delivery

                            signet-ring makes on wax. Nor, again, shall I be so credulous, in view
                            of the fact that the retentiveness or slowness of the memory depends
                            upon our physical condition, as to venture to allot a special art to

                            is more, of so doing not merely when we seek for such facts, but even at
                            times of its own accord, and not only in our waking moments, but even
                            when we are sunk in sleep. </p>

                            to their old home, however far they have been taken from it. Again, is
                            it not an extraordinary inconsistency that we forget recent and remember
                            distant events, that we cannot recall what happened yesterday and yet

                            or that memory does not always remain with us, but will even sometimes
                            return to us after it has been lost? But we should never have realised
                            the fullness of its power nor its supernatural capacities, but for the
                            fact that it is memory which has brought oratory to its present position

                            stringing merely a few words together; its capacity for endurance is
                            inexhaustible, and even in the longest pleadings the patience of the

                            training enables us to do things which we cannot do before we have had
                            any training or practice. On the other hand, I find that Plato <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                                275 A. </note> asserts that the use of written characters is a
                            hindrance to memory, on the ground, that is, that once we have committed
                            a thing to writing, we cease to guard it in our memory and lose it out
                            of sheer carelessness. </p>

                            turns to, and not away from, the objects which it contemplates. Thus it
                            results that after writing for several days with a view to acquiring by
                            heart what we have written, we find that our mental effort has of itself

                            athletes, to celebrate the achievement of one who had gained the crown
                            for boxing. Part of the sum for which he had contracted was refused him
                            on the ground that, following the common practice of poets, he had
                            introduced a digression in praise of Castor and Pollux, and he was told
                            that, in view of what he had done, he had best ask for the rest of the
                            sum due from those whose deeds he had <pb n="v10-12 p.219"/> extolled. And

                            invited, by a message to the effect that two youths who had ridden to
                            the door urgently desired his presence. He found no trace of them, but
                            what followed proved to him that the gods had shown their gratitude.

                            considerable absence, we not merely recognise the place itself, but
                            remember things that we did there, and recall the persons whom we met

                            save for the fact that under such circumstances the mind is apt to
                            become indolent, with the result that other thoughts break in. For this

                            the memory may derive assistance from the double effort of speaking and
                            listening. But our voice should be subdued, rising scarcely above a

                            the process of learning will be slower, because the perception of the
                            eye is quicker than that of the ear, while, on the other hand, when we

                            our memory and match it against the voice of the reader. It is, indeed,
                            important for other reasons to test ourselves thus from time to time,
                            since continuous reading has this drawback, that it passes over the
                            passages which we find hard to remember at the same speed as those which

                            feature in common: namely, that good health, sound digestion, and
                            freedom from other preoccupations of mind contribute largely to the

                            in which it depends entirely on ourselves, whereas in a game our

                            serve to guide the memory. For just as it is easier to learn verse than
                            prose, so it is easier to learn prose when it is artistically
                            constructed than when it has no such organisation. If these points

                            courtesy forced me to repeat part of what I had said. There are persons

                            reading and re-reading what they have written or read, a process which
                            we may compare to chewing the cud. This task will be rendered less
                            tiresome if we begin by confining ourselves to learning only a little at
                            a time, in amounts not sufficient to create disgust: we <pb n="v10-12 p.237"/> may then proceed to increase the amount by a line a

                            awkward hesitation or even a tongue-tied silence. It is, therefore, far
                            safer to secure a good grasp of the facts themselves and to leave

                            more impressive than the best speech unaccompanied by such power. </p>

                            second and third place as well, until his questioner ceased to trouble
                            him. We are therefore almost justified in concluding that he regarded it

                        <p> All delivery, as I have already said, is concerned with two different
                            things, namely, voice and gesture, <pb n="v10-12 p.251"/> of which the one
                            appeals to the eye and the other to the ear, the two senses by which all
                            emotion reaches the soul. But the voice has the first claim on our
                            attention, since even our gesture is adapted to suit it. The first point
                            which calls for consideration is the nature of the voice, the second the
                            manner in which it is used. The nature of the voice depends on its
                            quantity and quality. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div n="15" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> The question of quantity is the simpler of the two, since as a rule it
                            is either strong or weak, although there are certain kinds of voice
                            which fall between these extremes, and there are a number of gradations
                            from the highest notes to the lowest and from the lowest to the highest.
                            Quality, on the other hand, presents more variations; for the voice may
                            be clear or husky, full or thin, smooth or harsh, of wide or narrow
                            compass, rigid or flexible, and sharp or flat, while lung-power may be

                        <p> It is not necessary for my purpose to enquire into the causes which give
                            rise to these peculiarities. I need not raise the question whether the
                            difference lies in those organs by which the breath is produced, or in
                            those which form the channels for the voice itself; whether the voice
                            has a character of its own or depends on the motions which produce it;
                            whether it be the strength of the lungs, chest or the vocal organs
                            themselves that affords it most assistance, since the co-operation of
                            all these organs is required. For example, it is not the mouth only that
                            produces sweetness of tone; it requires the assistance of the nostrils
                            as well, which carry off what I may describe as the overflow of the
                            voice. The important fact is that the tone must be agreeable and not
                            harsh. </p>

                        <p> The methods of using the <pb n="v10-12 p.253"/> voice present great
                            variety. For in addition to the triple division of accents into sharp,
                            grave and circumflex, there are many other forms of intonation which are
                            required: it may be intense or relaxed, high or low, and may move in
                            slow or quick time. </p>

                            the voice: for though it possesses but few varieties to which we can
                            give a name, yet every human being possesses a distinctive voice of his
                            own, which is as easily distinguished by the ear as are facial

                            although the two methods have many points in common. In both cases
                            physical robustness is essential to save the voice from dwindling to the
                            feeble shrillness that characterises the voices of eunuchs, women and
                            invalids, and the means for creating such robustness are to be found in
                            walking, rubbing-down with oil, abstinence from sexual intercourse, an
                            easy digestion, and, in a word, in the simple life. </p>

                            or squeaky. For just as the sound produced in the pipe by the same
                            volume of breath varies according as the stops are closed or open, or
                            the instrument is clogged or cracked, so the voice is strangled if the
                            throat be swollen, and muffled if it <pb n="v10-12 p.255"/> is obstructed,
                            while it becomes rasping if the throat is inflamed, and may be compared

                            rear of the object struck. An excess of moisture also impedes the voice,
                            while a deficiency weakens it. As regards fatigue, its effect is the
                            same as upon the body: it affects the voice not merely at the moment of
                            speaking, but for some time afterwards. </p>

                            civil affairs to be able to allot fixed times for taking a walk, and he
                            cannot tune his voice through all the notes of the scale nor spare it
                            exertion, since it is frequently necessary for him to speak in several

                            his voice, whereas we have often to speak in harsh and agitated tones,
                            must pass wakeful nights, swallow the soot that is produced by the

                            transition between boyhood and manhood, since at that period it is
                            naturally weak, not, I think, on account of heat, as some allege (for

                            second essential is variety of tone, and it is in this alone that

                            later) is the necessity of adapting the voice to suit the nature of the
                            various subjects on which we are speaking and the moods that they
                            demand: otherwise our voice will be at variance with our language. We
                            must, therefore, avoid that which the Greeks call <hi rend="italic">monotony,</hi> that is to say, the unvarying exertion both of lungs
                            and voice. By this I do not simply mean that we must avoid saying
                            everything in a loud tone, a fault which amounts to madness, or in a

                            length, we should collect our breath, but quickly, noiselessly and
                            imperceptibly. On other occasions we shall be able to take breath at the

                            permissible: but if we are to call it singing, it must be no more than a
                            suggestion of singing, a fact which too many refuse to realise. </p>

                            delivery. Such appropriateness obviously lies in the adaptation of the
                            delivery to the subjects on which we are speaking. This quality is, in
                            the main, supplied by the emotions themselves, and the voice will ring
                            as passion strikes its chords. But there is a difference between true
                            emotion on the one hand, and false and fictitious emotion on the other.
                            The former breaks out naturally, as in the case of grief, anger or
                            indignation, but lacks art, and therefore requires to be formed by
                            methodical training. </p>

                            and to exhibit an emotion that cannot be distinguished from the truth.
                            The voice, which is the intermediary between ourselves and our hearers,
                            will then produce precisely the same emotion in the judge that we have
                            put into it. For it is the index of the mind, and is capable of

                            it, obeys the impulse of the mind. Its importance in oratory is
                            sufficiently clear from the fact that there are many things which it can

                        <p> For we can indicate our will not merely by a gesture of the hands, but
                            also with a nod from the head: signs take the place of language in the
                            dumb, and the movements of the dance are frequently full of meaning, and
                            appeal to the emotions without any aid from words. The temper of the
                            mind can be inferred from the glance and gait, <pb n="v10-12 p.281"/> and

                            movement should have such power, when pictures, which are silent and
                            motionless, penetrate into our innermost feelings with such power that
                            at times they seem more eloquent than language itself. On the other

                        <p> Gesture and movement are also productive of grace. It was for this
                            reason that Demosthenes used to practise his delivery in front of a
                            large mirror, since, in spite of the fact that its reflexions are
                            reversed, he trusted his eyes to enable him to judge accurately the
                            effect produced. The head, being the chief member of the body, has a
                            corresponding importance in delivery, serving not merely to produce
                            graceful elect, but to illustrate our meaning as well. </p>

                            influence over it is the blood, which moves in conformity with the
                            emotions that control the mind, causing a blush on a skin that is
                            sensitive to shame, and giving place to an icy pallor under the
                            influence of fear, whereas, when it is under control, it produces a

                            harpist by a movement of the hands as though they were plucking the
                            strings. But this is a type of gesture which should be rigorously

                            dignified performers on the stage. I should, therefore, permit him to
                            direct his hand towards his body to indicate that he is speaking of
                            himself, or to point it at some one else to whom he is alluding,

                            the other hand, I would not allow him to use his hands to imitate

                            relaxed rather than extended and the thumb slanted inwards: this last
                            gesture is well adapted to pointing to one side or marking the different

                            to and fro, the shoulders swaying gently in unison: this is adapted to
                            passages where we speak with restraint and almost with timidity. Wonder
                            is best expressed as follows: the hand turns slightly upwards and the
                            fingers are brought in to the palm, one after the other, beginning with
                            the little finger; the hand is then opened and turned round by a

                            of the thumb-nail with its extremity, the other fingers being relaxed,
                            we shall have a graceful gesture well suited to express approval or to

                            expresses promise or assent, a more violent movement suggests
                            exhortation or sometimes praise. There is also that familiar gesture by
                            which we drive home our words, consisting in the rapid opening and
                            shutting of the hand: but this is a common rather than an artistic

                            exhortation. The tremulous motion now generally adopted by foreign
                            schools is, however, fit only for the stage. I do not know why some
                            persons disapprove of the movement of the fingers, with their tops
                            converging, towards the mouth. For we do this when we are slightly
                            surprised, and at times also employ it to express fear or entreaty when
                            we are seized with sudden indignation. </p>

                            even to force the voice through the teeth in phrases such as <quote>What

                        <p> Motion is generally divided into six kinds, but circular motion must be
                            regarded as a seventh. The latter alone is faulty when applied to
                            gesture. The remaining motions— that is, forward, to right or left and
                            up or down—all have their significance, but the gesture is never
                            directed to what lies behind us, though we do at <pb n="v10-12 p.301"/>

                        <p> The best effect is produced by letting the motion of the hand start from
                            the left and end on the right, but this must be done gently, the hand
                            sinking to rest and avoiding all appearance of giving a blow, although
                            at the end of a sentence it may sometimes be allowed to drop, but must
                            quickly be raised again: or it may occasionally, when we desire to
                            express wonder or dissent, spring back with a rapid motion. In this
                            connexion the earlier instructors in the art of gesture rightly added
                            that the movement of the hand should begin: and end with the thought
                            that is expressed. Otherwise the gesture will anticipate or lag behind
                            the voice, both of which produce an unpleasing effect. </p>

                            rule is never observed, nor can it be. These persons, however, were
                            desirous that there should be some standard of speed or slowness (a most
                            rational desire), with a view to avoid prolonged inactivity on the part
                            of the hands as well as the opposite fault, into which so many fall, of

                        <p> From this springs a further error, namely, that young men, when writing

                            advance and consider as they compose how the hand is to fall at each
                            particular point. A further unfortunate result is that the movement of
                            the hand, which should end on the right, frequently finishes on the
                            left. </p>

                        <p> It is therefore better, in view of the fact that all speech falls into a
                            number of brief clauses, at the end of which we can take breath, if
                            necessary, to arrange our gesture to suit these sections. For example,
                            the words <hi rend="italic">novum crimes, Gai Caesar,</hi> in a sense
                            form a phrase complete in itself, since they are followed by a
                            conjunction, while the next words, <hi rend="italic">et ante hanc diem
                                non auditum,</hi> are also sufficiently self-contained. To these
                            phrases the motions of the hand must be conformed, before the speech has
                            passed beyond the calmness of tone on which it opens. </p>

                            Some places are best suited by a rapid, and others by a restrained
                            delivery. In the one case we pass rapidly on, fire a volley of arguments
                            and hurry upon our way; in the other, we drive home our points, force
                            them on the hearer and implant them in his mind. But the slower the
                            delivery, the greater its emotional power: thus, Rosins was rapid and
                            ESOPs weighty in his delivery, because the former was a comic and the
                            latter a tragic actor. </p>

                                trial, the feat would he more difficult, But apparently the court
                                took up less room in such cases, and the orator's peregrinations
                                would be but small. See § 134 note. </note> On the other hand, we

                            the same reason his gestures must also be carried a little higher, while
                            there are other details which will readily occur to my reader without
                            any mention from me. Similar modifications will be likewise necessary

                        <p> For example, when the speaker sits on the left side of the judge, he
                            will have to advance his right foot, while if he be seated on the right,
                            many of his gestures must be made from right to left, in order that they
                            may be addressed to the judge. Personally, I note that many speakers
                            start up at the conclusion of individual periods, while some proceed to
                            walk to and fro for a little: it is for them to decide whether this is
                            becoming or not: I will merely remark that, when they do this, they are

                            anything of the kind. For if a man cannot endure the burdens imposed by
                            oratory without having recourse to such remedies, he should not find it
                            a serious hardship to give up pleading altogether, a course which is far
                            preferable to acknowledging his contempt both for his profession and his

                            but his dress comes more under the public eye than that of other men. It
                            should, therefore, be distinguished and manly, as, indeed, it ought to
                            be with all men of position. For <pb n="v10-12 p.319"/> excessive care
                            with regard to the cut of the toga, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> In putting on the toga, it was thrown first
                                over the left shoulder, so that about 6 feet hung in front and about
                                12 behind. This longer portion was then carried round under the
                                right arm and then diagonally across the chest (like a <hi rend="italic">balleus,</hi> or belt) and over the left shoulder
                                again. A fold of this portion hanging in front formed the <hi rend="italic">sinus.</hi> The original <milestone n="6" unit="section"/> feet hanging in front from the left shoulder
                                now hung below the rest. A portion was pulled up from above and
                                Allowed to hang over the edge of that portion of the toga which
                                Quintilian compares to a <hi rend="italic">balleus.</hi> This was
                                known as the <hi rend="italic">umbo,</hi> and is described by
                                Quintilian as <hi rend="italic">pars quae ultima imponitur.</hi> He
                                recommends that a considerable portion should be thus pulled up and
                                allowed to hang fairly low in front over the edge of the <hi rend="italic">balteus,</hi> that the weight of the hanging
                                portion might balance the remainder of the original 6 feet of toga
                                hanging from the left shoulder, keep it in place and prevent it from
                                slipping lack into its original position. The toga was very nearly
                                semicircular in shape, which explains Quintilian's statement that it
                                should be round. For further details see <hi rend="italic">Companion

                            style of the shoes, or the arrangement of the hair, is just as
                            reprehensible as excessive carelessness. There are also details of dress
                            which are altered to some extent by successive changes in fashion. The
                            ancients, for example, wore no folds, and their successors wore them
                            very short. </p>

                        <p> Consequently it follows that in view of the fact that their arms were,
                            like those of the Greeks, covered by the garment, they must have
                            employed a different form of gesture in the exordium from that which is
                            now in use. However, I am speaking of our own day. The speaker who has
                            not the right to wear the broad stripe, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Worn by senators.</note> will wear his girdle in
                            such a way that the front edges of the tunic fall a little below his
                            knees, while the edges in rear reach to the middle of his hams. For only
                            women draw them lower and only centurions higher. </p>

                        <p> If we wear the purple stripe, it requires but little care to see that it
                            fills becomingly; negligence in this respect sometimes excites
                            criticism. Among those who wear the broad stripe, it is the fashion to
                            let it hang somewhat lower than in garments that are retained by the
                            girdle. The toga itself should, in my opinion, be round, and cut to fit,
                            otherwise there are a number of ways in which it may be unshapely. Its
                            front edge should by preference reach to the middle of the shin, while
                            tie back should be higher in proposition as the girdle is higher <pb n="v10-12 p.321"/> behind than in front. </p>

                            lower edge of the tunic, and should certainly never fall below it. The
                            other fold which passes obliquely like a belt under the right shoulder
                            and over the left, should neither be too tight nor too loose. The
                            portion of the toga which is last to be arranged should fall rather low,
                            since it will sit better thus and be kept in its place. A portion of the
                            tunic also should be drawn back in order that it may not fall over the
                            arm when we are pleading, and the fold should be thrown over the
                            shoulder, while it will not be unbecoming if the edge be turned back.

                            varicose veins, despite the fact that this fashion is to be seen in the

                            calls for no alarm, and may involve issues of great or trivial
                            importance. We ought, therefore, never to be so preoccupied over
                            particular portions of a case as to forget to consider the case as a

                            revealed both by voice and gesture. A persuasive effect, on the other
                            hand, is produced by the power of assertion, which is sometimes more

                            entirely different merits. But that is the less surprising owing to the
                            fact that the one was at his best in the rôles of gods, young men, good
                            fathers and slaves, matrons and respectable old women, while the other
                            excelled in the portrayal of sharptempered old men, cunning slaves,
                            parasites, pimps and all the more lively characters of comedy. For their
                            natural gifts differed. For Demetrius' voice, like his other qualities,
                            had greater charm, while that of Stratocles was the more powerful. </p>

                        <p> But yet more noticeable were the incommunicable peculiarities of their
                            action. Demetrius showed unique gifts in the movements of his hands, in
                            his power to charm his audience by the longdrawn sweetness of his
                            exclamations, the skill with which he would make his dress seem to puff
                            out with wind as he walked, and the expressive movements of the right
                            side which he sometimes introduced with effect, in all of which things
                            he was helped by his stature and personal beauty. </p>

                        <p> On the other hand, Stratocles' <hi rend="italic">forte</hi> lay in his
                            nimbleness and rapidity of movement, in his laugh (which, though not
                            always in keeping with the character lie represented, he deliberately
                            employed to awaken answering laughter in his audience), and finally,
                            even in the way in which he sank his neck into his shoulders. If either
                            of these actors had attempted any of his rival's tricks, he would have
                            produced a <pb n="v10-12 p.347"/> most unbecoming effect. Consequently,
                            every man must get to know his own peculiarities and must consult not
                            merely the general rules of technique, but his own nature as well with a
                            view to forming his delivery. </p>

                            as well, that the prime essential is a sense of proportion. For I am not
                            trying to form a comic actor, but an orator. Consequently, we need not
                            study all the details of gesture nor, as regards our speaking, be
                            pedantic in the use we make of the rules governing punctuation, rhythm

                            I have set myself to perform. Indeed had I fully realised the
                            difficulties when I first designed this work, I should have considered
                            betimes whether my strength was sufficient to support the load that now
                            weighs upon me so heavily. But to begin with, I felt how shameful it
                            would be to fail to perform what I had promised, and later, despite the
                            fact that my labour became more and more arduous at almost every stage,
                            the fear of stultifying what I had already written sustained my courage
                            through every difficulty. </p>

                            rather than despair. But the fact that I began with comparatively
                            trivial details deceived me. Subsequently I was lured still further on
                            my voyage by the temptations of the favouring breeze that filled my
                            sails; but the rules which I was then concerned to give were still of a
                            familiar kind and had been already treated by most writers of rhetorical
                            textbooks: thus far I seemed to myself to be still in sight of shore and
                            I had the company of many who had ventured to entrust themselves to the
                            self-same winds. </p>

                            be an orator unless he is a good man. For it is impossible to regard
                            those men as gifted with intelligence who on being offered the choice
                            between the two paths of virtue and of vice choose the latter, nor can
                            we allow them prudence, when by the unforeseen issue of their own
                            actions they render themselves liable not merely to the heaviest

                            will most assuredly never become an orator. To this must be added the
                            fact that the mind will not find leisure even for the study of the
                            noblest of tasks, unless it first be free from vice. The reasons for
                            this are, first, that vileness and virtue cannot jointly inhabit in the
                            selfsame heart and that it is as impossible for one and the same mind to
                            harbour good <pb n="v10-12 p.359"/> and evil thoughts as it is for one man

                            among which must be included even those preoccupations which are free
                            from blame. For it is only when it is free and self-possessed, with

                            But does that mean that we are to suppose that praise is an object of

                            realised that oratory is in the main concerned with the treatment of
                            what is just and honourable? Can a bad and unjust man speak on such

                            he who is the better man. Consequently, the bad man and the perfect

                            often be incumbent on the orator whom I desire to form, but merely to
                            show that, in the event of his being compelled to take such action, it
                            will not invalidate our definition of an orator as a <quote>good man,

                            resemblance to bad and, the charges which tell heavily against an
                            innocent person frequently have a strong resemblance to the truth.
                            Consequently, the same methods of defence have to be employed that would
                            be used if he were guilty. Further, there are countless elements which
                            are common to both good cases and bad, such as oral and documentary
                            evidence, suspicions and opinions, all of which have to be established

                            the truth. Therefore, while maintaining his integrity of purpose, the

                            that the philosophers, when they exert their powers of speaking to
                            defend these virtues, are using the weapons of rhetoric, not their own.

                            to Asia and there studied under a number of professors of philosophy and
                            rhetoric, but above all under Apollonius Molon, whose lectures he had
                            attended at Rome and to whom he now at Rhodes entrusted the refashioning
                            and recasting of his style. It is only when theory and practice are
                            brought into a perfect harmony that the orator reaps the reward of all

                            them; and to regard it as a sin to demand the punishment of crime is
                            almost equivalent to the sanctioning of crime, while it is certainly
                            contrary to the interest of the good to give the wicked free leave to

                            from ingratitude. And even if a client should prove ungrateful, it is

                            payment as a fee, but rather as the expression of the principle that one
                            good turn deserves another, since he will be well aware that he has
                            conferred far more than he receives. For it does not follow that because

                        <p> The old orators indeed used to conceal their eloquence, a method which
                            is recommended by Marcus Antonius, as a means of securing that the
                            speaker's words should carry conviction and of masking the advocate's
                            real designs. But the truth is that the eloquence of those days was
                            capable of concealment, for it had not yet attained that splendour of
                            diction which makes it impossible to hide its light under a bushel.
                            Therefore artifice and stratagem should be masked, since detection in
                            such cases spells failure. Thus far, and thus only, may eloquence hope
                            to enjoy the advantages of secrecy. </p>

                            confronted by elements which must either strike the attention or be
                            condemned to nonexistence. But the very fact that they strike the
                            attention is a reason why they should not flaunt themselves obtrusively.
                            And, if we have to make the choice, I should prefer that it should be
                            the cause, and not the orator, to which we award our praise.
                            Nevertheless, the true orator will achieve the distinction of seeming to
                            speak with all the excellence that an excellent case deserves. One thing
                            may be regarded as certain, that no one can <pb n="v10-12 p.441"/> plead
                            worse than he who wins applause despite the disapproval meted out to his
                            case. For the inevitable conclusion is that the applause must have been
                            evoked by something having no connexion with the case. </p>

                            likely to detract from his reputation because the subject matter does
                            not allow his genius full scope. For the strongest reason for
                            undertaking a case is to be fund in our duty towards our clients: nay,
                            we should even desire the suits in which our friends are involved to he
                            as unimportant as possible, and remember that the advocate who gives an
                            adequate presentment to his case, has spoken exceeding well. </p>

                            false if necessary, the sole consideration that weighs with them being
                            that it affords exercise for their talents and is likely to win applause
                            during its delivery. Such conduct seems to me so unworthy of our perfect
                            orator that, in my opinion, he will not even bring true charges against

                            is the duty of the orator to refuse to comply with his clients' desires.
                            For how can a man with the least degree of gentlemanly feeling consent

                            show, the art and the artist are involved in the consideration of all
                            these forms. But they differ greatly from one another, and not merely in
                                <hi rend="italic">species,</hi> as statue differs from statue,
                            picture from picture and speech from speech, but in <hi rend="italic">genus</hi> as well, as, for example, Etruscan statues differ from
                            Greek and Asiatic orators from Attic. </p>

                            especial pride. Euphranor, on the other hand, was admired on the ground

                            to antiquity. The former were regarded as concise and healthy, the
                            latter as empty and inflated: the former were remarkable for the absence
                            of all superfluity, while the latter were deficient alike in taste and
                            restraint. The reason for this division, according to some authorities,
                            among them Santra, is to be found in the fact that, as Greek gradually
                            extended its range into the neighbouring cities of Asia, there arose a
                            class of men who desired to distinguish themselves as orators before
                            they had acquired sufficient command of the language, and who
                            consequently began to express by periphrases what could have been
                            expressed directly, until finally this practice became an ingrained

                            they addressed: the Athenians, with their polish and refinement, refused

                            school are neither so concise as the Attic nor redundant like the
                            Asiatic school, but appear to derive their style in part from their

                            prepared to grant that there is Lysias, since he is the favourite model

                            And yet it is to the school of Isocrates that we owe the greatest

                            an eloquent speaker. If all that was required of the latter was merely
                            to indicate the facts, he might rest content with literalness of
                            language, without <pb n="v10-12 p.475"/> further elaboration. But since it
                            is his duty to delight and move his audience and to play upon the

                            additional aids which are granted to us by that same nature which gave
                            us speech. </p>

                            differently on different subjects and observe distinctions of character.
                            Consequently the more effective a man's speaking, the more in accordance

                            account the delectation of his audience as well, since, as he pointed

                            to listen, and his face will often (as Cicero <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Not in any extant work.</note> reminds us) serve
                            as a guide to the speaker. Consequently we must press the points that we

                            speaking, or as imposing too many subjects of study on the learner. For
                            in addition to the many branches of knowledge which have to be studied
                            in boyhood and the traditional rules of eloquence, I have enjoined the
                            study of morals and of civil law, so that I am afraid that even those
                            who have regarded these things as essential to my theme, may he appalled
                            at the delay which they impose and abandon all hope of achievement

                            should not grow old over one special form of exercise. We have been in a
                            position to acquire varied knowledge, to familiarise ourselves with the

                            speaking is of such a nature that it does not demand many years for its
                            acquisition. For any one of the various branches of knowledge which I

                            indefinite amount of time to be devoted to it. The rest depends entirely

                        <p> Add to this the further consideration that even moderate eloquence is
                            often productive of great results and, if such studies are to be
                            measured solely by their utility, is almost equal to the perfect
                            eloquence for which we seek. Nor would it be difficult to produce either
                            ancient or recent examples to show that there is no other source from
                            which men have reaped such a harvest of wealth, honour, friendship and
                            glory, both present and to come. But it would be a disgrace to learning
                            to follow the fashion of those who say that they pursue not virtue, but
                            only the pleasure derived from virtue, and to demand this meaner
                            recompense from the noblest of all arts, whose practice and even whose
                            possession is ample reward for all our labours. </p>

                            the fairest gift of god to man, without which all things are stricken
                            dumb and robbed alike of present glory and the immortal record of
                            posterity; and let us press forward to whatsoever is best, since, if we
                            do this, we shall either reach the summit or at least see many others

                            seemed to me that I might, as far as in me lay, help to advance the
                            teaching of oratory. If the knowledge of these principles proves to be
                            of small practical utility to the young student, it should at least
                            produce what [value more,—the will to do well. <pb n="v10-12 p.517"/>
