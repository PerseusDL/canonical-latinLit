                            importuned me with the request that I should at length take steps to
                            publish the book on the Education of an Orator which I dedicated to my
                            friend Marcellus. For my own view was that it was not yet ripe for
                            publication. As you know I have spent little more than two years on its
                            composition, during which time moreover I have been distracted by a
                            multitude of other affairs. These two years have been devoted not so
                            much to actual writing as to the research demanded by a task to which
                            practically no limits can be set and to the reading of innumerable
                            authors. </p>

                        <p> Having at length, after twenty years devoted to the training of the
                            young, obtained leisure for study, I was asked by certain of my friends
                            to write something on the art of speaking. For a long time I resisted
                            their entreaties, since I was well aware that some of the most
                            distinguished Greek and Roman writers had bequeathed to posterity a
                            number of works dealing with this subject, to the composition of which
                            they had devoted the utmost care. </p>

                    <div n="2" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> This seemed to me to be an admirable excuse for my refusal, but served
                            merely to increase their enthusiasm. They urged that previous writers on
                            the subject had expressed different and at times contradictory opinions,
                            between which it was very difficult to choose. They thought therefore
                            that they were justified in imposing on me the task, if not of
                            discovering original views, at least of passing definite judgment on
                            those expressed by my predecessors. </p>

                        <p> I was moved to comply not so much because I felt confidence that I was
                            equal to the task, as <pb n="v1-3 p.7"/> because I had a certain
                            compunction about refusing. The subject proved more extensive than I had
                            first imagined; but finally I volunteered to shoulder a task which was
                            on a far larger scale than that which I was originally asked to
                            undertake. I wished on the one hand to oblige my very good friends
                            beyond their requests, and on the other to avoid the beaten track and
                            the necessity of treading where others had gone before. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div n="4" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> For almost all others who have written on the art of oratory have
                            started with the assumption that their readers were perfect in all other
                            branches of education and that their own task was merely to put the
                            finishing touches to their rhetorical training; this is due to the fact
                            that they either despised the preliminary stages of education or thought
                            that they were not their concern, since the duties of the different
                            branches of education are distinct one from another, or else, and this
                            is nearer the truth, because they had no hope of making a remunerative
                            display of their talent in dealing with subjects, which, although
                            necessary, are far from being showy: just as in architecture it is the
                            superstructure and not the foundations which attracts the eye. </p>

                        <p> I on the other hand hold that the art of oratory includes all that is
                            essential for the training of an orator, and that it is impossible to
                            reach the summit in any subject unless we have first passed through all
                            the elementary stages. I shall not therefore refuse to stoop to the
                            consideration of those minor details, neglect of which may result in
                            there being no opportunity for more important things, and propose to
                            mould the studies of my orator from infancy, on the assumption that his
                            whole education has been entrusted to my charge. </p>

                        <p> This work I dedicate <pb n="v1-3 p.9"/> to you, Marcellus Victorius. You
                            have been the truest of friends to me and you have shown a passionate
                            enthusiasm for literature. But good as these reasons are, they are not
                            the only reasons that lead me to regard you as especially worthy of such
                            a pledge of our mutual affection. There is also the consideration that
                            this book should prove of service in the education of your son Geta,
                            who, young though he is, already shows clear promise of real talent. It
                            has been my design to lead my reader from the very cradle of speech
                            through all the stages of education which can be of any service to our
                            budding orator till we have reached the very summit of the art. </p>

                        <p> I have been all the more desirous of so doing because two books on the
                            art of rhetoric are at present circulating under my name, although never
                            published by me or composed for such a purpose. One is a two days'
                            lecture which was taken down by the boys who were my audience. The other
                            consists of such notes as my good pupils succeeded in taking down from a
                            course of lectures on a somewhat more extensive scale: I appreciate
                            their kindness, but they showed an excess of enthusiasm and a certain
                            lack of discretion in doing my utterances the honour of publication.

                            theme will be treated with greater system and with as great perfection

                            essential for such an one is that he should be a good man, and
                            consequently we demand of him not merely the possession of exceptional
                                <pb n="v1-3 p.11"/> gifts of speech, but of all the excellences of

                            philosophy. The man who can really play his part as a citizen and is
                            capable of meeting the demands both of public and private business, the
                            man who can guide a state by his counsels, give it a firm basis by his
                            legislation and purge its vices by his decisions as a judge, is

                            the place to discuss the question as to whether it is better to have him

                            most famous states. It would, however, be folly to shut our eyes to the
                            fact that there are some who disagree with this preference for public
                            education owing to a certain prejudice in favour of private tuition.
                            These persons seem to be guided in the main by two principles. In the
                            interests of morality they would avoid the society of a number of human
                                <pb n="v1-3 p.41"/> beings at an age that is specially liable to
                            acquire serious faults: I only wish I could deny the truth of the view
                            that such education has often been the cause of the most discreditable
                            actions. Secondly they hold that whoever is to be the boy's teacher, he
                            will devote his time more generously to one pupil than if he has to
                            divide it among several. </p>

                            morality, I should give my vote for virtuous living in preference to
                            even supreme excellence of speaking. But in my opinion the two are
                            inseparable. I hold that no one can be a true orator unless he is also a
                            good man and, even if he could be, I would not have it so. I will
                            therefore deal with this point first. It is held that schools corrupt
                            the morals. </p>

                            of the preservation of a good reputation under either circumstance. The
                            nature of the individual boy and the care devoted to his education make
                            all the difference. Given a natural bent toward evil or negligence in
                            developing and watching over modest behaviour in early years, privacy
                            will provide equal opportunity for sin. The teacher employed at home may
                            be of bad character, and there is just as much danger in associating
                            with bad slaves as there is with immodest companions of good birth. </p>

                            will be neglected. But a good teacher will not burden himself with a
                            larger number of pupils than he can manage, and it is further of the
                            very first importance that he should be on friendly and intimate terms

                            criticism so far that they were not content with obelising lines or
                            rejecting books whose titles they regarded as spurious, as though they
                            were expelling a supposititious child from the family circle, but also
                            drew up a canon of authors, from which some were omitted altogether.

                        <p> Nor is it sufficient to have read the poets only; every kind of writer
                            must be carefully studied, not merely for the subject matter, but for
                            the vocabulary; for words often acquire authority from their use by a
                            particular author. Nor can such training be regarded as complete if it
                            stop short of music, for the teacher of literature has to speak of metre
                            and rhythm: nor again if he be ignorant of astronomy, can he understand
                            the poets; for they, to mention no further points, frequently give their
                            indications of time by reference to the rising and setting of the stars.
                            Ignorance of philosophy is an equal drawback, since there are numerous
                            passages in almost every poem based on the most intricate questions of
                            natural philosophy, while among the Greeks we have Empedocles and among
                            our own poets Varro and Lucretius, all of <pb n="v1-3 p.65"/> whom have

                            teaching of literature, the superstructure will collapse. The study of
                            literature is a necessity for boys and the delight of old age, the sweet
                            companion of our privacy and the sole branch of study which has more

                            into semivowels and mutes. But as the pupil gradually approaches the

                        <p> This, however, occurs far more frequently in Greek words such as <hi rend="italic">Atrei,</hi> which in our young days was pronounced by
                            the most learned of our elders with an acute accent on the first
                            syllable, necessitating a grave accent on the second; the same remark
                            applies to <hi rend="italic">Nerei</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Terei.</hi> Such has been the tradition as regards accents. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The Roman accent was a stress,
                                while the Greek was a pitch accent, though by the Christian era
                                tending to change into stress. Roman grammarians borrow the Greek
                                terminology and speak of accents in terms of pitch. The explanation
                                of this is probably that the Roman stress accent was accompanied by
                                an elevation of the pitch. Here the acute accent certainly implies
                                stress; the grave implies a drop in pitch and the absence of stress.
                                The circumflex means that the voice rises slightly and then falls
                                slightly, but implies stress. See Lindsay, <hi rend="italic">Latin

                            have no Latin equivalent. Similiarly they at tines borrow words from us.
                            In this connexion the problem arises whether foreign words should be

                            rules are called <hi rend="italic">orthography</hi> by the Greeks; let
                            us style it the science of writing correctly. This science does not
                            consist merely in the knowledge of the letters composing each syllable
                            (such a study is beneath the dignity of a teacher of grammar), but, in
                            my opinion, develops all its subtlety in connexion with doubtful points.

                        <p> For instance, while it is absurd to place a circumflex over all long
                            syllables since the quantity of most syllables is obvious from the very
                            nature of the word which is written, it is all the same occasionally
                            necessary, since the same letter involves a different meaning according
                            as it is long or short. For example we determine whether <hi rend="italic">mains</hi> is to mean an <quote>apple tree</quote> or
                            a <quote>bad man</quote> by the use of the circumflex; </p>

                            syllable is long, a <quote>marsh,</quote> if it be short; again when the
                            same letter is short in the nominative and long in the ablative, we
                            generally require the circumflex to make it clear which quantity to
                            understand. </p>

                        <p> Similarly it has been held that we should observe distinctions such as

                            compounded with <hi rend="italic">specto,</hi> there will be an <hi rend="italic">s</hi> in the second syllable, while there will be no

                        <p> Again the following distinction has frequently been observed: <hi rend="italic">ad</hi> is spelt with a <hi rend="italic">d</hi> when

                            conjunction, while <hi rend="italic">cum</hi> is spelt <hi rend="italic">quum</hi> when it denotes time, but <hi rend="italic">cum</hi> when

                        <p> It is often debated whether in our spelling of prepositions we should be

                            For example since the latter part of <hi rend="italic">haruspex</hi> is

                            the letter o was sometimes long and short, as it is with us, and again
                            was sometimes used to express the syllable <pb n="v1-3 p.139"/> which is

                            the effeminate modulations now in vogue: there is an excellent saying on

                            citing the example of Gaius Gracchus, the leading orator of his age, who
                            during his speeches had a musician standing behind him with a pitchpipe,
                            or <hi rend="italic">tonarion</hi> as the Greeks call it, whose duty it

                            than I have been in stating that the music which I desire to see taught
                            is not our modern music, which has been emasculated by the lascivious

                            family, calmed them by ordering the piper to change her strain to a
                            spondaic measure, while Chrysippus selects a special tune to be used by

                            which it is supposed that a piper is accused of manslaughter because he
                            had played a tune in the Phrygian mode as an accompaniment to a

                            quickness of perception. But it is considered that the value of geometry
                            resides in the process of learning, and not as with other sciences in
                            the knowledge thus acquired. Such is the general opinion. </p>

                            one is concerned with numbers, the other with figures. Now knowledge of
                            the former is a necessity not merely to the orator, but to any one who
                            has had even an elementary education. Such knowledge is frequently
                            required in actual cases, in which a speaker is regarded as deficient in
                            education, I will not say if he hesitates in making a calculation, but
                            even if he contradicts the calculation which he states in words by

                            geometry. And is it not equally a necessity for oratory? Geometry
                            arrives at its conclusions from definite premises, and by arguing from
                            what is certain proves what was previously uncertain. Is not this just
                            what we do in speaking? Again are not the problems of geometry almost
                            entirely solved by the <pb n="v1-3 p.179"/> syllogistic method, a fact
                            which makes the majority assert that geometry bears a closer resemblance
                            to logic than to rhetoric? But even the orator will sometimes, though

                            who have acquired sufficient knowledge to be able to teach rhetoric as
                            well; but when they do so, they are performing the duties of the

                        <p> A further point into which we must enquire concerns the age at which a
                            boy may be considered sufficiently advanced to profit by the
                            instructions of the rhetorician. In this connexion we must consider not
                            the boy's actual age, but the progress he has made in his studies. To
                            put it briefly, I hold that the best answer to the question <quote>When
                                should a boy be sent to the school of rhetoric?</quote>

                            dependent on that previously raised. For if the duties of the teacher of
                            literature are prolonged to include instruction in deliberative
                            declamation, this will <pb n="v1-3 p.209"/> postpone the need for the
                            rhetorician. On the other hand if the rhetorician does not refuse to
                            undertake the first duties of his task, his instruction will be required
                            from the moment the boy begins to compose narratives and his first

                            proper control, it is none the less desirable to keep the weaker members
                            separate from the more mature, and to avoid not only the actual charge
                            of corruption but the merest suspicion of it. </p>

                            both he and his school must be free from the grosser vices. And should
                            there be any father who does not trouble to choose a teacher for his son

                            prefer to keep them for a while under inferior masters, on the ground
                            that in the elementary stages a mediocre instructor is easier to
                            understand and to imitate, and less reluctant to undertake the tiresome

                            to get rid of faults which have once become engrained; for it places a
                            double burden on the shoulders of the later teacher and the preliminary

                            The mistake to which I am referring is, however, twofold. First they
                            regard these inferior teachers as adequate for the time being and are
                            content with their instruction because they have a stomach that will

                            and not inferior in quality as well. Secondly, and this is a still
                            commoner delusion, they think that those who are blest with greater
                            gifts of speaking will not condescend to the more elementary details,
                            and that consequently they sometimes disdain to give attention to such

                            are more disposed to imitate their schoolfellows than their masters,
                            since such imitation comes more easily to them. Some of my readers may

                            the incompetent teacher on the other hand is quite likely to give his

                        <p> Now there are three forms of narrative, without counting the type used
                            in actual legal cases. First there is the fictitious narrative as we get
                            it in tragedies and poems, which is not merely not true but has little
                            resemblance to truth. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> With
                                special reference to the element of the miraculous. Ovid's <hi rend="italic">Metamorphoses</hi> would give a good example.
                            </note> Secondly, there is the realistic narrative as presented by
                            comedies, which, though not true, has yet a certain verisimilitude.
                            Thirdly there is the historical narrative, which is an exposition of
                            actual fact. Poetic narratives are the property of the teacher of
                            literature. The rhetorician therefore should begin with the historical
                            narrative, whose force is in proportion to its truth. </p>

                            revel in elaborate descriptions, such as those in which so many are led

                            to the question as to whether this exercise is more nearly related to
                            deliberative or controversial oratory depends on custom and law and
                            consequently varies in different states. Among the Greeks the proposer
                            of a law was called upon to set forth his case before a judge, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                                assembly, who examined the provisions of the proposed law. </note>

                            in such cases are few in number and of a definite type. For there are
                            only three kinds of law, <hi rend="italic">sacred, public</hi> and <hi rend="italic">private.</hi>

                            appointment as tribune of the plebs was alleged to be unconstitutional.

                            easier to understand. Others on the contrary would select the more
                            florid school of writers on the ground that they are likely to provide
                            the nourishment best suited to the minds of the young. </p>

                            simplest and most intelligible. For instance, when prescribing for boys,
                            I should give Livy the preference over Sallust; for, although the latter
                            is the greater historian, one requires to be well-advanced in one's

                            from him, but to come to love him. After Cicero I should, following the
                            advice of Livy, place such authors as most nearly resemble him. </p>

                            the utmost care. Firstly no teacher suffering from an excessive
                            admiration of antiquity, should be allowed to cramp their minds by the
                            study of Cato and the Gracchi and other similar authors. For such
                            reading will give them a harsh and bloodless style, since they will as
                            yet be unable to understand the force and vigour of these authors, and
                            contenting themselves with a style which doubtless was admirable in its
                            day, but is quite unsuitable to ours, will come to think (and <pb n="v1-3 p.257"/> nothing could be more fatal) that they really

                            blooms produced by our modern euphuists, thus acquiring a passion for
                            the luscious sweetness of such authors, whose charm is all the more
                            attractive to boyish intellects because it is so easy of achievement.

                            should strongly recommend the reading of ancient authors, since if,
                            after clearing away all the uncouthness of those rude ages, we succeed
                            in absorbing the robust vigour and virility of their native genius, our
                            more finished style will shine with an added grace: I also approve the
                            study of the moderns at this stage, since even they have many merits.

                            superiors. It will therefore be possible to select much that is valuable
                            from modern writers, but we must take care that the precious metal is
                            not debased by the dross with which it is so closely intermingled. </p>

                            differed. Some have not been content with giving directions as to the
                            arrangement of the subjects set them as themes for declamation, but have
                            developed them at some length themselves, supplying not merely the
                            proofs, but the lines upon which the emotional passages should proceed.

                        <p> Others have merely suggested a bare outline, and then when the
                            declamations were over, have indicated the points missed by each speaker
                            and worked up certain passages with no less care than they would have

                            more profitable to point out the right road at the outset, and not
                            merely to recall the pupil from his error when he has already gone

                            declamation, he has to take them down and think about them: secondly
                            instruction is always more readily received than reproof. Indeed those
                            of our pupils who have a lively disposition are liable in the present

                            discussion, which ought in my opinion undoubtedly to be changed. They
                            should not be forced to commit all their own compositions to memory and
                            to deliver them on an appointed day, as is at present the custom. This
                            practice is especially popular with the boys' fathers, who think that
                            their sons are not really studying unless they declaim on every possible
                            occasion, although as a matter of fact progress depends <pb n="v1-3 p.263"/> mainly on industry. </p>

                            rather that for the purpose of learning by heart passages should be
                            selected from the orators or historians or any other works that may be

                            form an intimate acquaintance with the best writings, will carry their

                            the time will as a rule have come for him to attempt deliberative and
                            forensic themes. But before I begin to discuss these, I must say a few
                            words on the theory of declamation, which is at once the most recent and
                            most useful of rhetorical exercises. </p>

                            the formation of an orator, since there is no excellence in a formal
                            speech which is not also to be found in this type of rhetorical

                            the extravagance and ignorance of our declaimers. But it is possible to

                            the erroneous judgment of faulty critics, who think that true vigour is
                            all the greater for its lack of art, regarding it as a special proof of
                            strength to force what might be opened, to break what might be untied

                            vigour, although it is of frequent occurrence in such cases for the
                            latter to be overthrown by his own strength and for the former to find

                            heads, although of the utmost importance in actual cases, makes the
                            outward show of strength seem less than the reality; the unhewn block is
                            larger than the polished marble, and things when scattered seem more

                            abuse too openly and too often, even though by so doing he imperils the

                            speaking well. The artist is he who has acquired the art, that is to

                            achievement of the artist, namely good speaking. Each of these three <hi rend="italic">general</hi> divisions is in its turn divided into <hi rend="italic">species.</hi> Of the two latter divisions I shall

                            first and chief disagreement on the subject is found in the fact that

                            consider that rhetoric, which, as I have already said, is the noblest

                            wits by the selection of a difficult theme, like Polycrates, when he
                            praised Busiris and Clytemnestra; I may add that he is credited with a
                            not dissimilar performance, namely the composition of a speech which was

                            defended on the ground that uneducated persons, barbarians and slaves,

                            teaching of rhetoric as an art was, they say, a later invention dating

                            experiment: wounds were bound up long before medicine developed into an

                            These critics also charge rhetoric with doing what no art does, namely
                            making use of vices to serve its ends, since it speaks the thing that is

                            does contradict itself; no art tries to demolish what itself has built,
                            but this does happen in the operations of rhetoric; or again:â rhetoric
                            teaches either what ought to be said or what ought not to be said;
                            consequently it is not an art because it teaches what ought not to be
                            said, or because, while it teaches what ought to be said, it also
                            teaches precisely the opposite. </p>

                            place therein and consequently it can scarcely happen even under the
                            most exceptional circumstances that an orator, that is to say, a good

                            not undo its own work. For the orator does not refute his own arguments,
                            nor does rhetoric even do so, because those who regard persuasion as its

                            fact that rhetoric does not always aim at telling the truth, but always
                            at stating what is probable? The answer is that the orator knows that
                            what he states is no more than probable. </p>

                            generally agreed, rhetoric must also be an art, since it differs from
                            logic in <hi rend="italic">species</hi> rather than in <hi rend="italic">genus.</hi> Nor must I omit to point out that where it is possible
                            in any given subject for one man to act without art and another with
                            art, there must necessarily be an art in connexion with that subject, as
                            there must also be in any subject in which the man who has received
                            instruction is the superior of him who has not. </p>

                            the trained speaker will get the better of the untrained. For even the
                            trained man will prove inferior to one who has received a better

                            us, since we concede the possession of oratory to none save the good

                            understand the subject of its study: such arts are called <hi rend="italic">theoretical.</hi> Others again are concerned with
                            action: this is their end, which is realised in action, so that, the

                            facts we must come to the conclusion that, in the main, rhetoric is
                            concerned with action; for in action it accomplishes that which it is

                            with the mere examination of a thing. Rhetoric is still in the orator's
                            possession even though he be silent, while if he gives up pleading
                            either designedly or owing to circumstances over which he has no
                            control, he does not therefore cease to be an orator, any more than a
                            doctor ceases to be a doctor when he withdraws from practice. </p>

                            art. Still, if rhetoric is to be regarded as one of these three classes
                            of art, since it is with action that its <pb n="v1-3 p.349"/> practice
                            is chiefly and most frequently concerned, let us call it an active or

                        <p> I quite realise that there is a further question as to whether eloquence
                            derives most from nature or from education. This question really lies
                            outside the scope of our inquiry, since the ideal orator must
                            necessarily be the result of a blend of both. But I do regard it as of
                            great importance that we should decide how far there is any real
                            question on this point. </p>

                        <p> For if we make an absolute divorce between the two, nature will still be
                            able to accomplish much without the aid of education, while the latter
                            is valueless without the aid of nature. If, on the other hand, they are
                            blended in equal proportions, I think we shall find that the average
                            orator owes most to nature, while the perfect orator owes more to
                            education. We may take a parallel from agriculture. A thoroughly barren
                            soil will not be improved even by the best cultivation, while good land
                            will yield some useful produce without any cultivation; but in the case
                            of really rich land cultivation will do more for it than its own natural
                            fertility. </p>

                            a block of Parian marble, its artistic value would owe more to his skill
                            than to the material. To conclude, nature is the raw material for
                            education: the one forms, the other is formed. Without material art can
                            do nothing, material without art does possess a certain value, while the

                            through incurring the hatred of the great, while sometimes, as for
                            instance in the trial of Milo, the orator may have to speak in the midst
                            of a crowd of armed soldiers? Consequently, if oratory be not a virtue,
                            perfection is beyond its grasp. </p>

                            of a port at Ostia came up for discussion, had not the orator to state
                            his views? And yet it was a subject requiring the technical knowledge of
                            the architect. </p>

                            swellings on the body are symptomatic of ill-health or poison? And yet
                            that is a question for the qualified physician. Will he not deal with
                            measurements and figures? And yet we must admit that they form part of
                            mathematics. For my part I hold that practically all subjects are under
                            certain circumstances liable to come up for treatment by the orator. If
                            the circumstances do not occur, the subjects will not concern him. </p>

                            assertion which is confirmed by the practice of everyday speech. For
                            when we have been given a subject on which to speak, we often preface
                            our remarks by calling attention to the fact that the matter has been

                            it produces nothing, but the artist must have them. The engraver cannot
                            work without his chisel nor the painter without his brush. I shall

                            that it was useful, that it was a virtue and that its material was all

                            can doubt that mankind received the gift of speech from nature at its
                            birth (for we can hardly go further back than that), while the
                            usefulness of speech brought improvement and study, and finally method

                            owing to some accusation being made against them, set themselves to
                            speak with studied care for the purpose of their own defence. This,
                            however, though a more honourable origin, cannot possibly be the
                            earlier, for accusation necessarily precedes defence. You might as well
                            assert that the sword was invented for the purpose of self-defence and

                            medicine by observing that some things were healthy and some the

                            speeches require much more. For not only what we say and how we say it
                            is of importance, but also the circumstances under which we say it. It
                            is here that the need of arrangement comes in. But it will be impossible
                            to say everything demanded by the subject, putting each thing in its

                            department common to them all and acting as their guardian. Again in the

                            to persuade, while the power of persuasion resides in the art.
                            Consequently, while it is the duty of the orator to invent and arrange,

                            to call them duties, since they are not preformed by others, but perform
                            something themselves. We must therefore conclude that they are <hi rend="italic">parts.</hi>

                            occurred to me that the tasks of oratory must either be concerned with

                            than that made by those who divide the task of oratory into that which
                            relates to things and that which concerns the emotions, <pb n="v1-3 p.399"/> since both of these will not always be present in

                            calling for any appeal to the emotions, which, although room cannot

                            on the other hand, as for instance Celsus, think that the orator will
                            not speak on any subject unless there is some question involved in it;
                            but the majority of writers on rhetoric are against him, as is also the

                            to be honourable and to denounce what is admittedly disgraceful are no

                            comprehensive, since it is from the <hi rend="italic">indefinite</hi>
                            question that the <hi rend="italic">definite</hi> is derived. I will
                            illustrate what I mean by an example. The question <quote>Should a man

                                <quote>Should Cato marry?</quote> is <hi rend="italic">definite,</hi> and consequently may be regarded as a subject for a
                                <hi rend="italic">deliberative</hi> theme. But even those which have
                            no connexion with particular persons are generally given a specific
                            reference. For instance the question <quote>Ought we to take a share in
                                the government of our country?</quote> is abstract, whereas
                                <quote>Ought we to take part in the government of our country under
                                the sway of a tyrant?</quote> has a specific reference. </p>

                            admission of time and quality; but all the same you would scarcely be
                            justified in calling it a cause or definite question. Those questions
                            which I have styled indefinite are also called <hi rend="italic">general:</hi> if this is correct, we shall have to call definite
                            questions <hi rend="italic">special</hi> questions. But in every special

                            relation to actual facts, since in the former case we argue merely with

                            that no money ever came into his client's hands. Still I should say that
                            the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> was to be found in the latter as being

                            powers to prove that Clodius lay in wait for Milo and was therefore
                            rightly killed. The point on which above all the orator must make up his

                            various lines of argument in support of his case, is this: what is it
                            that he wishes most to impress upon the mind of the judge? But although
                            this should be the first point for his consideration, it does not follow

                                93. </note> expresses this view in the following words:â <quote> the
                                argument on which the defence first takes its stand with a view to
                                rebutting the charge. </quote> This involves a further question as
                            to whether the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> can only be determined by
                            the defence. Cornelius Celsus is strongly against this view, and asserts
                            that the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> is derived not from the denial of
                            the charge, but from him who affirms his proposition. Thus if the
                            accused denies that anyone has been killed, the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> will originate with the accuser, because it is the
                            latter who desires to prove: if on the other hand the accused asserts
                            that the homicide was justifiable, the burden of proof has been
                            transferred and the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> will proceed from the
                            accused and be affirmed by him. I do not, however, agree. </p>

                            useful at first to adopt a slightly less rigid method: the road will not
                            be absolutely straight to begin with, but it will be more open and will
                            provide easier going. I would have them therefore learn above all things
                                <pb n="v1-3 p.453"/> that there are four different methods which may

                            them as first essentials. For, to begin with the defendant, far the
                            strongest method of self-defence is, if possible, to deny the charge.
                            The second best is when it is possible to reply that the particular act
                            with which you are charged was never committed. The third and most
                            honourable is to maintain that the act was justifiable. If none of these
                            lines of defence are feasible, there remains the last and only hope of
                            safety: if it is impossible either to deny the charge or justify the
                            act, we must evade the charge with the aid of some point of law, making
                            it appear that the action has been brought against us illegally </p>

                            custom. There are also certain things which although equitable are
                            prohibited by law; witness the restrictions placed on testamentary

                            son, but he will defend his claim by appealing to the intention of the
                            law, which he will maintain to imply that the bastard, born when there

                            But in this connexion each will rely on his own particular question. For
                            the disinherited son will say that even a disinherited man does not
                            cease <pb n="v1-3 p.463"/> to be a son, and will derive an argument from
                            that very law which denies his claim to the inheritance; namely that it
                            was unnecessary for a disinherited son to be excluded from possession of
                            his father's property if he had ceased to be one of the family; but now,
                            since in virtue of his rights as son he would have been his father's
                            heir if he had died intestate, the law is brought to bar his claim; and
                            yet the law does not deprive him of his position as son, but only of his
                            position as heir. Here the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> is <hi rend="italic">definitive,</hi> as turning on the definition of a

                            received ampler justice from the verdict of posterity than from that of
                            their own age. Children reflect glory on their parents, cities on their

                            institutions on those that first introduced them; for instance Numa
                            first laid down rules for the worship of the gods, and Publicola first
                            ordered that the lictors' rods should be lowered in salutation to the

                            notoriety and unpopularity of vices. In regard to some persons, as in

                            their natural advantages were nullified by their vices: the poets for

                            Aristotle also urges a point, which at a later date Cornelius Celsus

                            necessary for us to suffer something, but we are not compelled to do
                            anything; whereas the subject of deliberation is primarily whether we

                            worse things, the question will be one of expediency. For example, if a

                            failure of food and water supplies, discusses surrender to the enemy,

                            pleasant or free from danger, it comes under questions of expediency.
                            Such topics arise from some contradiction; for example a thing is

                            theatre the orator will consider the advantages to be derived from
                            relaxation from toil, and the unbecoming and undesirable struggle for

                            the danger is so evident, we may add other arguments, such as that they

                            written. Do you suppose that Cicero thought in the same way or assumed

                            gave a voice so that though they spoke better than they could by nature,

                            persons, on account of their extraordinary realism. In the case of
                            declaimers indeed it is of the first importance that they should
                            consider what best suits each character: for they rarely play the role
                            of advocates in their declamations. As a rule they impersonate sons,
                            parents, rich men, old men, gentle or harsh of temper, misers,

                            acknowledge that in controversial speeches the tone is often lowered in

                            naturally. For there is a preference among those who invent such themes

                            than two, the bringing and rebutting of charges. Most authorities divide
                            the forensic speech into five parts: the <hi rend="italic">exordium,</hi> the <hi rend="italic">statement of facts,</hi> the

                            and the <hi rend="italic">peroration.</hi> To these some have added the
                                <hi rend="italic">partition into heads, proposition</hi> and <hi rend="italic">digression,</hi> the two first of which form part of

                            Why then, if <hi rend="italic">proposition</hi> is a part of a speech,

                            Such cases no longer arise in the public courts, since the praetor

                            increased anxiety as to the judgment it may be found to deserve. For up

                            at home and to confine ourselves to the education of your son and mine.

                            to mollify them, if they are like to prove adverse, just according as

                            not sure that the party favoured by the judge does not require to handle
                            the situation with even more care than his opponent. For perverse judges
                            have sometimes a preposterous tendency to give judgment against their
                            friends or in favour of those with whom they have a quarrel, and of

                        <p> Again some have been judges in cases where their own interests were
                            involved. I note, for instance, in the books of observations published
                            by Septimius that Cicero appeared in such a case, while I myself, when I
                            appeared on behalf of Queen Berenice, actually pleaded before her. In
                            such cases we must be guided by the same principles that I have laid
                            down above. The opponent of the judge will emphasise his confidence in
                            the justice of his client's cause, while the advocate of his interests
                            will express the fear that the judge may be influenced <pb n="v4-6 p.17"/> by a quixotic delicacy. </p>

                        <p> Further, if the judge is thought to have come into court with a
                            prejudice in favour of one side, we must try to remove or strengthen
                            that prejudice as circumstances may demand. Again occasionally we shall
                            have to calm the judges' fears, as Cicero does in the <hi rend="italic">pro Milone,</hi> where he strives to persuade them not to think
                            that Pompey's soldiers have been stationed in the court as a threat to
                            themselves. Or it may be necessary to frighten them, as Cicero does in
                            the <hi rend="italic">Verrines.</hi>

                        <p> There are two ways of bringing fear to bear upon the judges. The
                            commonest and most popular is to threaten them with the displeasure of
                            the Roman people or the transference of the juries to another class
                                <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                                their trial. If they fail in their duty, the constitution of the
                                panels will be altered and the <hi rend="italic">equites</hi> be
                                admitted as well. </note> ; the second is somewhat brutal and is
                            rarely employed, and consists in threatening them with a prosecution for
                            bribery: this is a method which is fairly safe with a large body of
                            judges, since it checks the bad and pleases the good members of the
                            jury, but I should never recommend its employment with a single judge
                                <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> It must be borne in mind
                                that <hi rend="italic">iudex</hi> may be a juryman forming one of a

                            undoubtedly makes the judge ready to receive instruction from us, but we
                            shall contribute still more to this effect if we give a brief and lucid
                            summary of the case which he has to try; in so doing we shall be
                            following the method adopted by Homer and Virgil at the beginning of

                                divided into two parts: of these, the first seemed to rest and in
                                the main to rely on the odium, now inveterate, arising from the
                                trial before Junius, while the other appeared to touch, merely as a
                                matter of form, and with a certain timidity and diffidence, on the
                                question of the charge of poisoning, though it is to try this point
                                that the present court has been constituted in accordance with the

                            But these peculiar circumstances arise from such a variety of causes as

                            are likely to be of service. If the case itself is weak, we may derive
                            help from the character of our client; if his character is doubtful, we
                            may find salvation in the nature of <pb n="v4-6 p.31"/> the case. If
                            both are hopeless, we must look out for something that will damage our
                            opponent. For though it is desirable to secure as much positive
                            good-will as possible, the next best thing is to incur the minimum of

                            advocate to put forward such pleas than for his client, since the former
                            can praise without laying himself open to the charge of arrogance and

                            common to other parts of a speech, but the best test of the

                        <p> A most attractive form of <hi rend="italic">exordium</hi> is that which
                            draws its material from the speech of our opponent, if only for the

                            been improvised on the spot to meet the needs of the case increases the
                            orator's reputation for natural talent by the readiness with which it is
                            produced and carries conviction owing to the simple and ordinary
                            language in which it is clothed. As a result, even although the rest of
                            the speech has been committed to writing and carefully elaborated, the
                            whole of the speech will often be regarded as extempore, simply because

                            law, as it so often does in the centumviral court, as for example when
                            we discuss, whether the heir of a woman who has died intestate should be
                            her son or brother, or whether puberty is to be reckoned by age or by
                            physical development. The same situation arises also in cases where the
                            facts admit of full statement, but are well known to the judge or have
                            been correctly set forth by a previous speaker. </p>

                            tragedy will provide an example, where Teucer accuses Ulysses of

                            lifeless body of his enemy with a blood-stained sword in his hands. To
                            this Ulysses does not merely reply that he did not do the deed, but adds
                            that he had no quarrel with Ajax, the contest between them having been
                            concerned solely with the winning of renown: he then goes on to say how
                            he came to be in the lonely place, how he found Ajax lying lifeless and
                            drew the sword from the wound. Then follow arguments based on these

                            they all of them were designed to prepare the minds of the judges. Again
                            in the <hi rend="italic">pro Vareno</hi> Cicero delayed his statement of

                            to rebut the charge, but to turn the tables on our opponents: thus after
                            first rebutting the charge, we make <hi rend="italic">our statement of
                                facts</hi> the opening of an incrimination of the other party just

                        <p> There will also not infrequently be certain cases, in which it is easy
                            to rebut the charge that is under trial, but the conduct of which is
                            hampered by the past life of our client and the many and serious crimes
                            which he has committed. We must dispose of these first, in order that
                            the judge may give a favourable hearing to our defence of the actual
                            facts which form the question at issue. For example, if we have to
                            defend Marcus Caelius, the best course for his advocate to adopt will be
                            to meet the imputations of luxury, wantonness and immorality which are
                            made against him before we proceed to the actual charge of poisoning. It
                            is with these points that the speech of Cicero in his defence is
                            entirely concerned. Is he then to go on to make a statement about the
                            property of Palla and explain the whole question of rioting, a charge
                            against which Caelius has already defended himself in the speech which

                            brief and plausible (for it is of no importance if we substitute clear

                            as rash, or attribute the opposite qualities to these persons if we are

                           <hi rend="italic">pro Mil.</hi> x. 28. </note> for instance, is

                            most effective stroke of all is his cunning feint of simplicity: <quote>
                                Milo, on the other hand, having been in the senate all day till the
                                house rose, went home, changed his shoes and clothes, and waited for
                                a short time, while his wife was getting ready, as is the way with
                                women. </quote>

                            producing facts which indicate the slow and tardy nature of Milo's
                            departure, but by the use of the ordinary language of everyday speech
                            and a careful concealment of his art. Had he spoken otherwise, his words
                            would by their very sound have warned the judge to keep an eye on the

                            with loans, letting and hiring and interdicts? Nor yet is it always

                            magnificence is a quality wholly out of keeping with such procedure.
                            Magnificence of diction is therefore no more specially appropriate to
                            the statement of facts than language calculated to excite pity or
                            hatred, or characterised by dignity, charm or wit. Each of these
                            qualities is admirable in its proper place, but none can be regarded as
                            the peculiar and inalienable property of this portion of the speech.

                            equally so in other portions of the speech. There are others <pb n="v4-6 p.85"/> who add palpability, which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">á¼Î½Î¬ÏÎ³ÎµÎ¹Î±.</foreign>

                            himself holds that more qualities are required. For in addition to
                            demanding that it should be plain, brief and credible, he would have it

                            great virtue, when a truth requires not merely to be told, but to some
                            extent obtruded, still it may be included under lucidity. Some, however,
                            regard this quality as actually being injurious at times, on the ground

                        <p> Sometimes, too, we get false statements of facts; these, as far as
                            actual pleading in the courts is concerned, fall into two classes. In
                            the first case the statement depends on external support; Publius

                            Rome. The other has to be supported by the speaker's native talent, and
                            sometimes consists simply in an assumption of modesty, which is, I
                            imagine, the reason why it is called a gloss, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            opinions held by certain rhetoricians. Most of them are in the habit, as
                            soon as they have completed the <hi rend="italic">statement of
                                facts,</hi> of digressing to some pleasant and attractive topic with

                        <p> This practice originated in the display of the schools of declaration
                            and thence extended to the courts as soon as causes came to be pleaded,
                            not for the benefit of the parties concerned, but to enable the
                            advocates to flaunt their talents. I imagine that they feared that if
                            the slender stream of concise statement, such as is generally required,
                            were followed by the pugnacious tone inevitable in the arguing of the
                            case, the speech would fall flat owing to the postponement of the

                        <p> The objection to this practice lies in the fact that they do this

                            case or reflecting whether what they are doing will in any way assist
                            them, on the assumption that it is always expedient and always
                            necessary. Consequently they transfer striking thoughts from the places
                            which they should have occupied elsewhere and concentrate them in this
                            portion of the speech, a practice which involves either the repetition
                            of a number of things that they have already said or their omission from
                            the place which was really theirs owing to the fact that they have
                            already been said. </p>

                            permit it. Indeed such a practice confers great distinction and
                            adornment on a speech, but only if the digression fits in well with the
                            rest of the speech and follows naturally on what has preceded, not if it
                            is thrust in like a wedge parting what should naturally come together.

                            room for digression; for example if the end of the <hi rend="italic">statement</hi> has been concerned with some specially horrible

                            that it was wrong to distract the judge from the truth by exciting his
                            pity, bringing influence to bear, and the like. Further, to seek to
                            charm the audience, when the aim of the orator was merely to win
                            success, was in their opinion not only superfluous for a pleader, but

                            approval. It is to the effect that there are some proofs adopted by the
                            orator which lie outside the art of speaking, and others which he
                            himself deduces or, if I may use the term, begets out of his case. The
                            former therefore have been styled <foreign xml:lang="grc">á¼ÏÎµÏÎ½Î¿Î¹</foreign> or <hi rend="italic">inartificial</hi> proofs,

                            similar methods as the circumstances of the case may demand. For it is

                            First, we have matters on which judgment has been given at some time or
                            other in cases of a similar nature: these are, however, more correctly
                            termed precedents, as for instance where a father's will has been
                            annulled or confirmed in opposition to his sons. Secondly, there are
                            judgments concerned with the case itself; it is from these that the name
                                <hi rend="italic">praeiudicium</hi> is derived: as examples I may

                        </note> Thirdly, there are judgments passed on the actual
                            case, as for example in cases where the accused has been deported, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Banished persons who have been

                            application is made for the recognition of an individual as a free man,
                                <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> When a slave claimed his

                                The Latin suggests that portions of a case might be tried by two

                                the two panels sitting conjointly. The <hi rend="italic">hasta</hi>

                            two cases. As for their reversal, this can rarely be <pb n="v4-6 p.161"/> obtained by denouncing the judges, unless they have been guilty of
                            obvious error. For each of those who are trying the case wishes the
                            decision given by another to stand, since he too has to give judgment

                            one party will style torture an infallible method of discovering the

                            changed it under the influence of pain, and whether he made it at the
                            beginning of the torture or only after it had continued some time. The

                            consequently have the advantage not merely of having read his book, but
                            of having heard most of his views from his own lips. He very justly lays
                            down the rule that in this connexion it is the first duty of an orator
                            to make himself thoroughly acquainted with the case, a remark which of
                            course applies to all portions of a speech. </p>

                            believing the witness or the reverse. And since there are two classes of

                            must see that his witness is neither timid, inconsistent nor imprudent.

                            at once proceed to question him on the point at issue. On the contrary
                            this point must be approached by a circuitous route in such a manner as

                            the case against him, so we must ask the reluctant witness a number of
                            questions relative to acts antecedent or subsequent to the case, places,
                            dates, persons, etcetera, with a view to luring him into some reply

                            apparently irrelevant and innocent character and then by comparing
                            previous with subsequent replies, frequently lead witnesses into such a
                            position that it becomes possible to extort useful admissions from them
                            against their will. </p>

                        <p> The schools, it is true, give no instruction either as to theory or
                            practice in this subject, and skill in examination comes rather from
                            natural talent or practice. If, however, I am asked to point out a model
                            for imitation, I can recommend but one, namely that which may be found
                            in the dialogues of the Socratics and more especially of Plato, in which
                            the questions put are so shrewd that although individually as a rule the
                            answers are perfectly satisfactory to the other side, yet the questioner
                            reaches the conclusion at which he is aiming. </p>

                        <p> Fortune sometimes is so kind that a witness gives an answer involving
                            some inconsistency, while at times (and this is a more frequent
                            occurrence) one witness contradicts another. But acute examination
                            methodically conducted will generally reach the same result which is so

                            questions about the past life of other witnesses or about the witness'
                            own character, with a view to discovering whether they can be charged
                            with some disgraceful conduct, or degrading occupation, with friendship

                        <p> I must however express the strongest disapproval of the practice of
                            sending a suborned witness to sit on the benches of the opposing party,
                            in order that on being called into the witness-box from that quarter he
                            may thereby do all the more damage to the case for the accused by
                            speaking against the party with whose adherents he was sitting or, while
                            appearing to help him by his testimony, deliberately giving his evidence
                            in such an extravagant and exaggerated manner, as not only to detract
                            from the credibility of his own statements, but to annul the advantage
                            derived from the evidence of those who were really helpful. I mention
                            this practice not with a view to encourage it, but to secure its
                            avoidance. Documentary evidence is not frequently in conflict with oral.
                            Such a circumstance may be turned to advantage by either side. For one
                            party will rest its case on the fact that the witness is speaking on
                            oath, the other on the unanimity of the signatories. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> An over-statement, since in
                                many cases the signatories could only testify that the statement was
                                that actually made by the deponent; with its truth they were not
                                necessarily concerned. </note>

                        <p> Again there is often a conflict between the evidence and the arguments.

                            the <pb n="v4-6 p.189"/> sanctity of their oath, while the arguments are
                            nought but ingenious juggling with the facts. The other party will argue

                            sides and the question arises with regard to themselves as to which are
                            the more respectable in character, or with regard to the case, which
                            have given the more credible evidence, with regard to the parties to the

                            would remind him that there are two ways in which these may be treated.
                            There is the general method, with regard to which there is an endless
                            dispute between the adherents of the Stoics and the Epicureans, as to
                            whether the world is governed by providence. The other is special and is
                            concerned with particular departments of the art of divination,
                            according as they may happen to affect the question at issue. </p>

                            of establishing or demolishing such evidence as the following will give
                            the orator plenty to do; as for example if certain words have been

                            invention, while the other will assert that they do not know what they

                            are all evidence analogous to documentary or oral evidence and rumours;
                            they are not discovered by the orator, but are given him with the case
                            itself. </p>

                            only possible in controversial matters. If on the other hand they are

                            Similar to these are the following arguments, which must therefore be
                            classed under this same head, since it is to this that they naturally
                            belong: <quote>A man has not lost what he never had</quote> : <quote>A

                            However, such arguments, being incontrovertible, are of the nature of

                            for instance, we may argue that he who says that the world was created
                            thereby implies that it is suffering decay, since this is the property

                        <p> There is another very similar form of argument, which consists in the
                            inference of facts from their efficient causes or the reverse, a process
                            known as argument from causes. The conclusion is sometimes necessary,
                            sometimes generally without being necessarily true. For instance, a body
                            casts a shadow in the light, and the shadow wherever it falls indicates
                            the presence of a body. </p>

                            instance, <quote> the sun colours the skin, but not <pb n="v4-6 p.247"/>
                                everyone that is coloured receives that colour from the sun; a

                                produce dust, nor is everyone that is dusty just come from a

                        <p> As examples of necessary conclusions on the other hand I may cite the
                            following: <quote>If wisdom makes a man good, a good man must needs be
                                wise</quote> ; and again, <quote>It is the part of a good man to act
                                honourably, of a bad man to act dishonourably,</quote> or <quote>
                                Those who act honourably are considered good, those who act
                                dishonourably are considered bad men. </quote> In these cases the
                            conclusion is correct. On the other hand, <quote> though exercise
                                generally makes the body robust, not everyone who is robust is given
                                to exercise, nor is everyone that is addicted to exercise robust.
                                Nor again, because courage prevents our fearing death, is every man
                                who has no fear of death to be regarded as a brave man; nor is the
                                sun useless to man because it sometimes gives him a headache.

                                the Thebans had lent a hundred talents to the Thessalians. These
                                documents he presented to the Thessalians as a reward for the

                                that the Thessalians should repay the money. </quote> The case is

                            property that has fallen into the hands of the victor: the difficulty
                            moreover lies not so much in the proof as in the way it should be put
                            forward. We may begin by stating that the rights of war do not hold good
                            in any matter which can be brought before a court of justice, and that
                            what is taken by force of arms can only be retained by force of arms,
                            and consequently, wherever the rights of war hold good, there is no room
                            for the functions of a judge, while on the contrary where the functions
                            of the judge come into play, the rights of war cease to have any force.

                        <p> The reason why it is necessary to discover this principle is to enable
                            us to bring the following argument into play: that prisoners of war are
                            free on returning to their native land just because the gains of war
                            cannot be retained except by the exercise of the same violence by which
                            they were acquired. Another peculiar feature of the case is that it is

                                states of Greece were represented. </note> and you will remember
                            that we have to employ different methods in pleading a case before the

                        <p> Secondly we may urge that the right to refuse payment could not have
                            been conferred by the victor because he possesses only what he holds,
                            but a right, being incorporeal, cannot be grasped by the hand. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            than, once discovered, to defend it with arguments such as that the
                            position of an heir and a conqueror are fundamentally different, since
                            right passes to the one and property to the other. </p>

                            passed to the victor, because the repayment of a sum of money lent by a
                            whole people is due to them all, and as long as any single one of them
                            survives, he is creditor for the whole amount: but the Thebans were
                            never all of them to a man in Alexander's power. </p>

                    <div n="118" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> The force of this argument resides in the fact that it is not based on
                            any external support, but holds good in itself. Proceeding to the third
                            line of argument we may note that the first portion of it is of a more
                            ordinary type, namely that the right to repayment is not based on the
                            actual document, a plea which can be supported by many arguments. Doubt
                            may also be thrown on Alexander's purpose: did he intend to honour them
                            or to trick them? Another argument peculiar to the subject (indeed it
                            practically introduces a new discussion) is that the Thebans may be
                            regarded as having in virtue of their restoration recovered the right
                            even though it be admitted that they had lost it. Again Cassander's
                            purpose may be discussed, but, as the case is being pleaded before the
                            Amphictyonic council, we shall find that the most powerful plea that can

                            that the examples which they use are old and quoted from the orators,

                            agree, he finally inferred the conclusion of the problem under

                        <p> I am aware that some writers have shown pedantic zeal in making a minute
                            classification of similes, and have pointed out that there is lesser
                            similitude (such as that of a monkey to a man or a statue when first
                            blocked out to its original), a greater similitude (for which compare
                            the proverb <quote>As like as egg to egg</quote> ), a similitude in
                            things dissimilar (an elephant, for instance, and an ant both belong to
                            the genus <hi rend="italic">animal</hi> ),and dissimilitude in things
                            similar (puppies and kids, for example, are unlike the parents, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            contrasted with things which are hard. But I cannot see that such

                        <p> It is more important for our purpose to note that arguments may be drawn
                            from similar, opposite, and dissimilar points of law. As an example of
                            the first, take the following passage from the <hi rend="italic">Topica</hi> of Cicero, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">iii. 15.</note> where he argues that a man to whom the usufruct of
                            a house has been left will not restore it in the interests of the heir
                            if it collapses; just as lie would not replace a slave if he should die.
                            The following will provide an example of an argument drawn from opposite
                            points of law: <quote> The absence of a formal contract is no bar to the
                                legality of a marriage, provided the parties cohabit by mutual
                                consent, since the signing of a formal document will count for
                                nothing in the absence of such mutual consent. </quote> An instance
                            of an argument drawn from dissimilar points of law occurs in the <hi rend="italic">pro Caecina</hi> of Cicero <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">xii. 34.</note> : </p>

                            be illustrated by the following example <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                                Because a man has bequeathed all his silver to a given person and
                                this bequest is regarded as including silver coin as well as plate,
                                it does not follow that he intended all outstanding debts to be paid
                                to the legatee. </quote>

                            included under the latter. For the statement that the relation of 1 to

                        <p> just as does the statement that a bad citizen may be compared to an
                            actual enemy. But arguments of this kind are carried still further:
                                <quote> If connexion with a male <pb n="v4-6 p.293"/> slave is
                                disgraceful to the mistress of the house, so is the connexion of the
                                master with a female slave. If pleasure is an end sought by dumb
                                animals, so also must it be with men. </quote>

                        <p> But these arguments may readily be met by arguments from dissimilars:
                                <quote> It is not the same thing for the master of the house to have
                                intercourse with a female slave as for the mistress to have
                                intercourse with a male slave; nor does it follow that because dumb
                                animals pursue pleasure, reasoning beings should do likewise.
                            </quote> Or they may even be met by arguments from opposites; as for
                            instance, <quote> Because pleasure is an end sought by dumb animals, it
                                should not be sought by reasoning beings. </quote>

                            pity, surely my argument may be assisted by the fact that Athens, the
                            wisest of all states, regarded pity not merely as an emotion, but even

                            to be regarded as condemned by the judgment of Marcus Cato, who asserted
                            that every adulteress was as good as a poisoner? As for reflexions drawn

                                referring to the rebuilding of Cicero's house. Cicero argued against
                                this in a speech to the senate (56 B.C.). </note> and in the oration

                            further researches on the subject, for I admit the possibilities of
                            making further discoveries. Still anything that may be discovered will
                            not differ greatly from what I have said here. <pb n="v4-6 p.299"/> I

                            Adultery must first be proved: once that is certain it can be used as an

                            prove the same thing. For instance, if one man is accused of having
                            murdered another for the sake of his property, it may be argued as
                            follows: <quote> You had expectations of succeeding to the inheritance,
                                which was moreover very large: you were a poor man, and at the time

                                also offended him whose heir you were, and knew that he intended to
                                alter his will. </quote> These arguments are trivial and commonplace
                            in detail, but their cumulative force is damaging. They may not have the
                            overwhelming force of a thunderbolt, but they will have all the

                            prosecution. It is in this sense that refutation is assigned the fourth

                        <p> As a rule no strong appeal to the emotions is made in refutation. It is

                            been considered harder than that of prosecution. In the first place
                            accusation is a simpler task: for the charge is put forward in one
                            definite form, but its refutation may take a number of different forms,
                            since as a rule it is sufficient for the accuser that his charge should
                            be true, whereas counsel for the defence may deny <pb n="v4-6 p.313"/>
                            or justify the facts, raise the question of competence, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> See III. vi. 23. No exact

                            straightforward and, if I may use the phrase, vociferous; but the
                            defence requires a thousand arts and stratagems. </p>

                        <p> Moreover the prosecutor generally produces a speech which he has
                            prepared at home, while the counsel for the defence has frequently to
                            deal with quite unexpected points. The prosecutor brings forward his
                            witnesses, while counsel for the defence has to refute the charge by
                            arguments drawn from the case itself. The prosecutor draws his material
                            from the odium excited by the charges, even though it have no
                            justification, denouncing parricide, sacrilege, or treason, whereas
                            counsel for the defence can only deny them. Consequently quite moderate
                            speakers have proved adequate in prosecution, while no one can be a good
                            counsel for the defence unless he possesses real eloquence. In a word,
                            it is just so much easier to accuse than to defend as it is easier to
                            inflict than to heal a wound. </p>

                            introduced from circumstances lying outside the case. For in the former

                            must be noted in the first place that we have to deal, not with our
                            adversary, but with the judge, and secondly that we shall have to employ
                            the deliberative rather than the forensic style. For we shall urge the
                            judge to fix his desire rather on the glory that is won by clemency than
                            on the pleasure that is given by vengeance. </p>

                            points. For instance, if the accuser allege that the accused had a

                            of the fact without dealing singly with each alleged motive, because the

                            be sufficient to deny them. This is done by Cicero in the <hi rend="italic">pro Cluentio,</hi>

                            the present, and consequently it is all the easier to show the

                            dissimilarity. For it is impossible for two cases to be alike in every
                            detail. For instance, if the case of Ahala,2 by whom Maelius was killed,
                            is quoted to justify Nasica for the slaying of Tiberius Gracchus, we may
                            argue that Maelius was endeavouring to make himself king, while all that
                            Gracchus had done was to bring forward laws in the interest of the
                            people, and that while Ahala was Master of the Horse, Nasica was a
                            private citizen. In the last resort, if all else prove unavailing, we
                            must see if <pb n="v4-6 p.327"/> we can show that the action adduced as

                                since they expelled this same Gnaeus Egnatius, on whose authority
                                you lay such stress, from his place in the senate. On the other
                                hand, if you attach most weight to the judgment of the censors, I
                                must point out that the censors retained the younger Egnatius, whom
                                his father disinherited by an act resembling a censorial decision,

                            the judges, while frequently arguments which, if stated without more
                            ado, would have removed all doubt, lose their force owing to the delay

                            the tact that the advocate thinks that they require additional support.
                            Our orator must therefore adopt a confident manner, and should always
                            speak as if he thought his case admirable. This quality, like all other

                            of reasoning that there must be something to form the subject of enquiry
                            and something else to provide the proof, while the third element which
                            has to be added may be regarded as resulting from the agreement of the

                            the major, the second the minor premise and the third the conclusion.

                            argument is often less suspect when thus disguised, and the charm with
                            which it is expressed makes it all the more convincing to our audience.
                            Unless indeed we think that Cicero was in error when he introduced
                            phrases such as the following into an argumentative passage: <quote>The
                                laws are silent in the midst of arms,</quote> and <quote>A sword is
                                sometimes placed in our hands by the laws themselves.</quote>
                            However, we must be careful to observe a happy mean in the employment of
                            such embellishments, so that they may prove a real ornament and not a
                            hindrance. </p>

                            with weight and dignity, enlivened by apt reflexions and diversified by
                            suitable figures; for there is nothing more tiresome than a dry
                            repetition of facts, which merely suggests a lack of confidence in the

                        <p> The majority of Athenians and almost all philosophers who have left
                            anything in writing on the art of oratory have held that the
                            recapitulation is the sole form of peroration. I <pb n="v4-6 p.387"/>
                            imagine that the reason why the Athenians did so was that appeals to the
                            emotions were forbidden to Athenian orators, a proclamation to this
                            effect being actually made by the court-usher. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Athenaens (xiii. 6, 590 E) states that a law
                                against appeals to the emotions was passed at Athens after
                                Hyperides' defence of 'hryne ( <hi rend="italic">see</hi>
                           <milestone n="2" unit="chapter"/>

                                But there is no real evidence for the existence of such a law save
                                in cases tried before the Areopagps (see Arist. <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi> I. i. 5). Appeals for pity were as freely employed
                                in the ordinary courts of Athens during the fourth century as at
                                Rome. When Xenophon ( <hi rend="italic">Mem.</hi> iv. iv. 4) says
                                that Socrates refused to beg mercy of his judges contrary to the
                                law, he seems to refer to the spirit, not the letter. </note> I am
                            less surprised at the philosophers taking this view, for they regard
                            susceptibility to emotion as a vice, and think it immoral that the judge
                            should be distracted from the truth by an appeal to his emotions and
                            that it is unbecoming for a good man to make use of vicious procedure to
                            serve his ends. None the less they must admit that appeals to emotion
                            are necessary if there are no other means for securing the victory of
                            truth, justice and the public interest. </p>

                        <p> It is however admitted by all that recapitulation may be profitably
                            employed in other portions of the speech as well, if the case is
                            complicated and a number of different arguments have been employed in
                            the defence; though no one will doubt but that there are many cases, in
                            which no recapitulation at all is necessary at any point, assuming, that
                            is, that the cases are both brief and simple. This part of the

                        <p> Both parties as a general rule may likewise employ the appeal to the
                            emotions, but they will appeal to different emotions and the defender
                            will employ such appeals with greater frequency and fulness. For the
                            accuser has to rouse the judge, while the defender has to soften him.
                            Still even the accuser will sometimes make his audience weep by the pity
                            excited for the man whose wrongs he seeks to avenge, while the defendant
                            will at times develop no small vehemence when he complains of the
                            injustice of the calumny or conspiracy of which <pb n="v4-6 p.389"/> he
                            is the victim. It will therefore be best to treat these duties
                            separately: as I have already said, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">IV. i. 27, 28.</note> they are much the same in
                            the peroration as in the exordium, but are freer and wider in scope in

                            should gain admittance and we have the whole speech before us. On the
                            other hand in the peroration we have to consider what the feelings of
                            the judge will be when he retires to consider his verdict, for we shall
                            have no further opportunity to say anything and cannot any longer

                            assuage his emotions. And the following brief rule may be laid down for
                            the observation of both parties, that the orator should display the full
                            strength of his case before the eyes of the judge, and, when he has made
                            up his mind what points in his case actually deserve or may seem to
                            deserve to excite envy, goodwill, dislike or pity, should dwell on those

                            outline them. This fuller treatment is specially required if the accused
                            be a man of violent, unpopular or dangerous character or if the <pb n="v4-6 p.391"/> condemnation of the accused is likely to cover the

                            the head of the conciliatory methods mentioned above. The appeal to tear

                            a more prominent place in the peroration than in the exordium, but I

                            passions of jealousy, hatred or anger. As regards the circumstances
                            likely to excite such feelings in the judge, jealousy will be produced
                            by the influence of the accused, hatred by the disgraceful nature of his
                            conduct, and anger by his disrespectful attitude to the court, if, for

                            emotion by tears. Such appeals to pity will be based either on the
                            previous or present sufferings of the accused, or on those which await
                            him if condemned. And the force of our appeal will be doubled if we
                            contrast the fortune which he now enjoys with that to which he will be

                                yours? </quote> Such a method is especially serviceable when, as was
                            the case with Milo, entreaty is not in keeping with the character of the

                            to do so? Consequently Cicero sought to win the judges' goodwill for
                            Milo by emphasising the staunchness of his character, and himself
                            assumed the role of suppliant. Impersonation may also be employed with
                            profit in such passages, and by impersonations I mean fictitious
                            speeches supposed to be uttered, such as an advocate puts into the mouth
                            of his client. The bare facts are no doubt moving in themselves; but
                            when we pretend that the persons concerned themselves are speaking, the

                            victims, men whose appearance alone would call forth his tears even
                            though they uttered never a word. And as their plea would awaken yet
                            greater pity if they urged it with their own lips, so it is rendered to
                            some extent all the more effective when it is, as it were, put into

                            who were men of the greatest distinction. For he persuaded the court
                            that nothing was more necessary in view of the critical position of
                            affairs than that Murena should assume the consulship on the
                            thirty-first of December. This form of appeal is now, however, almost
                            entirely obsolete, since the safety of the state is to-day dependent on
                            the watchful care of a single ruler, and cannot conceivably be

                        <p> I have spoken of accusers and accused because it is in situations
                            involving danger that the emotional appeal is most serviceable. But
                            private cases also admit of both kinds of peroration, namely, that which
                            consists in the recapitulation of the proofs and that which takes the
                            form of an appeal for pity, the latter being employed when the position
                            or reputation of the litigant seems to be in danger. For to <pb n="v4-6 p.407"/> embark on such tragic methods in trivial cases
                            would be like putting the mask and buskins of Hercules on a small child.

                            For sometimes our appeal falls flat owing to the ignorance, rusticity,

                            important that the advocate should take all necessary precautions in

                        <p>II. The peroration
                            is the most important part of forensic pleading, and in the main
                            consists of appeals to the emotions, concerning which I have
                            consequently been forced to say something. But I have not yet been able
                            to give the topic specific consideration as a whole, nor should I have
                            been justified in doing so. We have still, therefore, to discuss a task
                            which forms tile most powerful means of obtaining what we desire, and is
                            also more difficult than any of those which we have previously
                            considered, namely that of stirring the emotions of the judges, and of
                            moulding and transforming them to the attitude which we desire. </p>

                        <p> The few remarks which I have already made on this subject were only such
                            as were essential to my theme, while my purpose was rather to show what
                            ought to be done than to set forth the manner in which we can secure our
                            aim. I must now review the whole subject in a more exhaustive fashion.
                            There is scope for an appeal to the emotions, as I have already said,1
                            in every portion of a speech. Moreover these emotions present great
                            variety, and demand more than cursory treatment, since it is in their
                            handling that the power of oratory shews itself at its highest. Even a
                            slight and limited talent may, </p>

                            life to other departments of oratory, and in developing them to a
                            serviceable extent. At any rate there are, and have always been, a <pb n="v4-6 p.419"/> considerable number of pleaders capable of
                            discovering arguments adequate to prove their points. I am far from
                            despising such, but I consider that their utility is restricted to
                            providing the judge with such facts as it is necessary for him to know,
                            and, to be quite frank, I regard them merely as suitable persons to
                            instruct pleaders of real eloquence in the facts of a case. But few
                            indeed are those orators who can sweep the judge with them, lead him to
                            adopt that attitude of mind which they desire, and compel him to weep
                            with them or share their anger. </p>

                            form of eloquence that is the queen of all. For as a rule arguments
                            arise out of the case itself, and the better cause has always the larger
                            number to support it, so that the party who wills by means of them will
                            have no further satisfaction than that of knowing that his advocate did
                            not fail him. </p>

                        <p> But the peculiar task of the orator arises when the minds of the judges
                            require force to move them, and their thoughts have actually to be led
                            away from the contemplation of the truth. No instruction from the
                            litigant can secure this, nor can such power be acquired merely by the
                            study of a brief. Proofs, it is true, may induce the judges to regard
                            our case as superior to that of our opponent, but the appeal to the
                            emotions will do more, for it will make them wish our case to be the
                            better. And what they wish, they will also believe. </p>

                            by the orator he reveals his feelings while he is still sitting and

                        <p> Emotions however, as we learn from ancient authorities, fall into two
                            classes; the one is called <hi rend="italic">pathos</hi> by the Greeks
                            and is rightly and correctly expressed in Latin by <hi rend="italic">adfectus</hi> (emotion): the other is called <hi rend="italic">ethos,</hi> a word for which in my opinion Latin has no equivalent:
                            it is however rendered <hi rend="italic">by mores</hi> (morals) and
                            consequently the branch of philosophy known as <hi rend="italic">ethics</hi> is styled <hi rend="italic">moral</hi> philosophy by
                            us. </p>

                        <p> But close consideration of the nature of the subject leads me to think

                            in general that is meant as certain peculiar aspects; for the term <hi rend="italic">morals</hi> includes every attitude of the mind. The
                            more cautious writers have preferred to give the sense of the term
                            rather than to translate it into Latin. They therefore explain <hi rend="italic">pathos</hi>
                        <pb n="v4-6 p.423"/> as describing the more
                            violent emotions and <hi rend="italic">ethos</hi> as designating those
                            which are calm and gentle: in the one case the passions are violent, in
                            the other subdued, the former command and disturb, the latter persuade
                            and induce a feeling of goodwill. </p>

                            usually the ease, I still hold that there are some subjects which demand
                            that the more violent emotion should be continuous. But, although the
                            gentler emotions require less force and impetus, they call for no less
                            art and experience than the more vehement, and are demanded in a greater
                            number of cases, indeed in a certain sense they are required in all.

                            service to the cases which he undertakes. For the orator who gives the
                            impression of being a bad man while he is speaking, is actually speaking
                            badly, since his words seem to be insincere owing to the absence of <hi rend="italic">ethos</hi> which would otherwise have revealed itself.

                            in this latter connexion that the orator's task is even more onerous.
                            For though some things are hateful in themselves such as parricide,
                            murder, poisoning, other things have to be made to seem hateful. </p>

                            is sometimes positively ridiculous to counterfeit grief, anger and
                            indignation, if we content ourselves with accommodating our words and
                            looks and make no attempt to adapt our own feelings to the emotions to
                            be expressed. What other reason is there for the eloquence with which
                            mourners express their grief; or for the fluency which anger lends even
                            to the uneducated, save the fact that their minds are stirred to power
                            by the depth and sincerity of their feelings? Consequently, </p>

                            desire to produce in the mind of the judge. Will he grieve who can find
                            no trace of grief in the words with which I seek to move him to grief?
                            Will he be angry, if the orator who seeks to kindle his anger shows no
                            sign of labouring under the emotion which he demands from his audience?
                            Will he shed tears if the pleader's eyes are dry? It is utterly

                            Accordingly, the first essential is that those feelings should prevail
                            with us that we wish to prevail with the judge, and that we should be

                        <p> It is the man who is really sensitive to such impressions who will have
                            the greatest power over the emotions. Some writers describe the
                            possessor of this power of vivid imagination, whereby things, words and
                            actions are presented in the most realistic manner, by the Greek word

                            visions of which I am speaking to such an extent that we imagine that we

                            and seem to ourselves not to be dreaming but acting. Surely, then, it

                            in the fact that sayings designed to raise a laugh are generally untrue
                            (and falsehood always involves a certain meanness), and are often
                            deliberately distorted, and, further, never complimentary: while the
                            judgments formed by the audience on such jests will necessarily vary,
                            since the effect of a jest depends not on the reason, but on an emotion
                            which it is difficult, if not impossible, to describe. </p>

                            not merely by words or deeds, but sometimes even by touch. Moreover,
                            there is great variety in the things which raise a laugh, since we laugh
                            not merely at those words or actions which are smart or witty, but also
                                <pb n="v4-6 p.443"/> at those which reveal folly, anger or fear.
                            Consequently, the cause of laughter is uncertain, since laughter is
                            never far removed from derision. </p>

                            actors or fools, it has a certain imperious force of its own which it is

                            But just as salt, if sprinkled freely over food, gives a special relish
                            of its own, so long as it is not used to excess, so in the case of those
                            who have the salt of wit there is something about <pb n="v4-6 p.449"/>
                            their language which arouses in us a thirst to hear. Again, I do not

                            It has the same primary division as other departments of oratory, that
                            is to say, it is concerned with things and words. </p>

                        <p> The application of humour to oratory may be divided into three heads:
                            for there are three things out of which we may seek to raise a laugh, to
                            wit, others, ourselves, or things intermediate. In the first case we
                            either reprove or refute or make light of or retort or deride the
                            arguments of others. In the <pb n="v4-6 p.451"/> second we speak of
                            things which concern ourselves in a humorous manner and, to quote the
                            words of Cicero, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                           <hi rend="italic">de Or.</hi> II. lxxi. 289. </note> say things
                            which have a suggestion of absurdity. For there are certain sayings
                            which are regarded as folly if they slip from us unawares, but as witty
                            if uttered ironically. </p>

                        <p> The third kind consists, as Cicero also tells us, in cheating
                            expectations, in taking words in a different sense from what was
                            intended, and in other things which affect neither party to the suit,
                            and which I have, therefore, styled intermediate. </p>

                        <p> Further, things designed to raise a laugh may either be said or done. In
                            the latter case laughter is sometimes caused by an act possessing a
                            certain element of seriousness as well, as in the case of Marcus Caelius
                            the praetor, who, when the consul Isauricus broke his curule chair, had
                            another put in its place, the seat of which was made of leather thongs,
                            by way of allusion to the story that the consul had once been scourged
                            by his father: sometimes, again, it is aroused by an act which passes
                            the grounds of decency, as in the case of Caelius' box, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                           <hi rend="italic">cp. Pro
                                    Cael</hi> xxix. 69. There is no jest in this passage which lays
                                itself open to such censure. The jest must have consisted in some
                                action on the part of the orator. </note> a jest which was not fit
                            for an orator or any respectable man to make. </p>

                        <p> On the other hand the joke may lie in some remark about a ridiculous
                            look or gesture; such jests are very attractive, more especially when
                            delivered with every appearance of seriousness; for there are no jests
                            so insipid as those which parade the fact that they are intended to be
                            witty. Still, although the gravity with which a jest is uttered
                            increases its attraction, and the mere fact that the speaker does not
                            laugh himself makes his words laughable, there is also such a thing as a
                            humorous look, manner or <pb n="v4-6 p.453"/> gesture, provided always
                            that they observe the happy mean. Further, a jest will either be free
                            and lively, like the majority of those uttered by Aulus Galba, or
                            abusive, like those with which Junius Bassus recently made us familiar,
                            or bitter, like those of Cassius Severus, or gentle, like those of
                            Domitius Afer. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div n="28" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> Much depends on the occasion on which a jest is uttered. For in social
                            gatherings and the intercourse of every day a certain freedom is not
                            unseemly in persons of humble rank, while liveliness is becoming to all.
                            Our jests should never be designed to wound, and we should never make it
                            our ideal to lose a friend sooner than lose a jest. Where the battles of
                            the courts are concerned I am always better pleased when it is possible
                            to indulge in gentle raillery, although it is, of course, permissible to
                            be abusive or bitter in the words we use against our opponents, just as
                            it is permissible to accuse them openly of crime, and to demand the last
                            penalty of the law. But in the courts as elsewhere it is regarded as
                            inhuman to hit a man when he is down, either because he is the innocent
                            victim of misfortune or because such attacks may recoil on those who
                            make them. Consequently, the first points to be taken into consideration
                            are who the speaker is, what is the nature of the case, who is the
                            judge, who is the victim, and what is the character of the remarks that
                            are made. </p>

                        <p> It is most unbecoming for an orator to distort his features or use
                            uncouth gestures, tricks that arouse such merriment in farce. No less
                            unbecoming are ribald jests, and such as are employed upon the stage. As
                            for obscenity, it should not merely be banished from his language, but
                            should not even be suggested. For even if our <pb n="v4-6 p.455"/>
                            opponent has rendered himself liable to such a charge, our denunciation
                            should not take the form of a jest. </p>

                            his wit on every possible occasion, but must sacrifice a jest sooner
                            than sacrifice his dignity. </p>

                            over one that calls for pity. Moreover, there is a type of judge whose
                            temperament is too serious to allow him to tolerate laughter. </p>

                            not refrain even from jests that may recoil upon themselves. This was
                            the case with Sulpicius Longus, who, despite the fact that he was
                            himself surpassingly hideous, asserted of a man against whom he was
                            appearing in a case involving his status as a free man, that even his
                            face was the face of a slave. To this Domitius Afer replied, <quote>Is

                            the picture of a Gaul painted on a Cimbric shield, a figure to which
                            Mancia bore a striking resemblance. There were shops round the forum and
                            the shield had been hung up over one of them by way of a sign. </p>

                        <p> The narration of a humorous story may often be used with clever effect
                            and is a device eminently becoming to an orator. Good examples are the
                            story told of Caepasius and Fabricius, which Cicero tells in the <hi rend="italic">pro Cluentio,</hi> or the story told by Caelius of the
                            dispute between Decimus Laelius and his colleague when they were both in
                            a hurry to reach their province first. But in all such cases the whole
                            narrative must possess elegance and charm, while the orator's own
                            contribution to the story should be the most humorous element. Take for
                            instance the way in which Cicero gives a special relish to the flight of
                            Fabricius. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            which he recommended in speaking of the Servilian law. Crassus, in
                            reply, called for three readers and gave them the dialogues of Brutus'
                            father to read out. One of these dialogues was represented as taking
                            place on his estate at Privernum, the second on his estate at Alba, and
                            the third on his estate at Tibur. Crassus then asked where these estates
                            were. Now Brutus had sold them all, and in those days it was considered
                            somewhat discreditable to sell one's <pb n="v4-6 p.463"/> paternal
                            acres. Similar attractive effects of narrative may be produced by the

                            replying to our opponents; the method, however, in both cases is to some
                            extent the same. For there is nothing that can be said in attack that

                            at once more pointed and more elegant. In such cases resemblances
                            between things produce the best effects, more especially if we refer to
                            something of an inferior or more trivial nature, as in the jests of
                            which our forefathers were so fond, when they called Lentulus Spinther

                            when I was a boy, Junius Bassus, one of the wittiest of men, was

                            called attention to the unseemliness of the act. Whereupon Vatinius

                        <p> I need say no more on this form of humour. But the practice of combining

                            this composite character. A like use may be made of dissimilarity. Thus
                            a Roman knight was once drinking at tile games, and Augustus sent him
                            the following message, <quote>If I want to dine, I go home.</quote> To
                            which the other replied, <quote> Yes, <milestone n="64" unit="section"/>

                            rise to more than one kind of jest. For instance the following jests
                            made by Augustus and Galba differ in form. Augustus was engaged in
                            dismissing an officer with dishonour from his service: the officer kept
                            interrupting him with entreaties and said, <quote>What shall I say to my
                                father?</quote> Augustus replied, <quote>Tell him that I fell under
                                your displeasure.</quote> Galba, when a friend asked him for the
                            loan of a cloak, said, <quote>I cannot lend it you, as I am going to
                                stay at home,</quote> the point being that the rain was pouring
                            through the roof of his garret at the time. I will add a third example,
                            although out of respect to its author I withhold his name: <quote>You
                                are more lustful than a eunuch,</quote> where we are surprised by
                            the appearance of a word which is the very opposite of what we should
                            have expected. Under the same heading, although it is quite different
                            from any of the preceding, we must place the remark made by Marcus
                            Vestinus when it was reported to him that a certain man was dead.
                                <quote>Some day then he will cease to stink,</quote> was his reply.

                            example, showed humour in the way in which he denied a charge that had
                            been brought against him. His accuser had produced a canvas, in every

                            when he refuted the extravagant lies of Vibius Curius about his age:

                            thirty, remarked, <quote>That is true, for I have heard it for the last

                            reproached him for marrying Publilia, a young unwedded girl, when he was

                            against Curio, who always began his speeches by asking indulgence for

                            helped out by a certain verbal similarity, as in the retort made by
                            Trachalus to Suelius. The latter had said, <quote>If that is the case,
                                you go into exile</quote> : to which Trachalus replied, <quote>And

                            by another: for example, Augustus of blessed memory, when the Gauls gave

                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The civic crown of oak leaves
                                was given as a reward for saving the life of a fellow-citizen in

                                for valour, and Augustus pretends to believe that Dolabella had

                                between the intrinsic value and weight of the two decorations.
                                Further, Augustus was very parsimonious in bestowing military
                                decorations and had himself received the crown of oak leaves from
                                the senate as the saviour of Rome, a fact which must have rendered

                            Rome without the addition of any proper noun. He defines it as follows:

                            brevity, includes all the virtues of oratory. For it is entirely
                            concerned with persons and things to deal with which in appropriate

                            gives the following definition, which is, as he says, based on the views
                            expressed by Cato: <quote> Urbanity is the characteristic of a man who
                                has produced many good sayings and replies, and who, whether in
                                conversation, in social or convivial gatherings, in public speeches,
                                or under any other circumstances, will speak with humour and
                                appropriateness. If any orator do this, he will undoubtedly succeed

                            the remark recorded by Marsus as having been made by Pompey to Cicero

                            omitted to deal with it on the ground perhaps that they thought the
                            subject had been sufficiently covered by their precepts on other topics.

                            by his opponent. Consequently while it is most important for every

                            will often be reduced <pb n="v4-6 p.507"/> to silence and forced to give

                            often leads an advocate right away from the point and forces him both to
                            use gross and insulting language and to receive it in return;

                            display of wit. This injunction, however, applies only so long as the
                            case is conducted with order and decency: if, on the other hand, our
                            opponents adopt turbulent methods we must put on a bold front and resist

                            those for the cross examination of witnesses, the only difference lying
                            in the fact that the debate is a battle between advocates, whereas
                            cross-examination is a fight between advocate and witness. To practise
                            the art of debate is, however, far easier. For it is most profitable to
                            agree with a fellow-student on some subject, real or fictitious, and to
                            take different sides, debating it as would be done in the courts. The
                            same may also be done with the simpler class of questions. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            dealt with these points to the best of my ability, I should have had no
                            hesitation in proceeding to discuss arrangement, which is logically the
                            next consideration, did I not fear that, since there are some who
                            include judgment <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See III. iii.

                            had deliberately omitted all discussion of judgment, although personally
                            I regard it as so inextricably blent with and involved in every portion
                            of this work, that its influence extends even to single sentences or
                            words, and it is no more possible to teach it than it is to instruct the

                            the judgment. What use then is it for me to lay down general rules to
                            the effect that we should not attempt impossibilities, that we should
                            avoid whatever contradicts our case or is common to both, and shun all
                            incorrectness or obscurity of style? In all these cases it is common
                            sense that must decide, and common sense cannot be taught. </p>

                        <p> There is no great difference, in my opinion, between judgment and
                            sagacity, except that the former deals with evident facts, while the
                            latter is concerned with hidden facts or such as have not yet been
                            discovered or still remain in doubt. Again judgment is more often than
                            not a matter of <pb n="v4-6 p.517"/> certainty, while sagacity is a form
                            of reasoning from deep-lying premises, which generally weighs and
                            compares a number of arguments and in itself involves both invention and
                            judgment. </p>

                        <p> But here again you must not expect me to lay down any general rules. For
                            sagacity depends on circumstances and will often find its scope in
                            something preceding the pleading of the cause. For instance in the
                            prosecution of Verres Cicero seems to have shown the highest sagacity in
                            preferring to cut down the time available for his speech rather than
                            allow the trial to be postponed to the following year when Quintus

                            important place. For it is the duty of sagacity to decide what we should
                            say and what we should pass by in silence or postpone; whether it is
                            better to deny an act or to defend it, when we should employ an exordium
                            and on what lines it should be designed, whether we should make a
                            statement of facts and if so, how, whether we should base our plea on
                            law or equity and what is the best order to adopt, while it must also
                            decide on all the nuances of style, and settle whether it is expedient
                            to speak harshly, gently or even with humility. </p>

                            has never been found one single case which was exactly like any other,
                            the pleader must rely upon his sagacity, keep his eyes open, exercise
                            his powers of invention and judgment and look to himself for advice. On
                            the other hand, I do not deny that there are some points which are
                            capable of demonstration and which accordingly I shall be careful not to
                            pass by. </p>

                            quote no others, is provided by Demosthenes and Aeschines, who adopt a
                            different order in the trial of Ctesiphon, since the accuser begins by
                            dealing with the legal question involved, in which he thought he had the
                            advantage, whereas the advocate for the defence treats practically every
                            other topic before coming to the question of law, with a view to
                            preparing the judges for a consideration of the legal aspect of the

                            state, but is still all-important) was what each party desired to
                            establish and then what means he was likely to adopt to that end. My
                            method was as follows. I considered what the prosecutor would say first:
                            his point must either be admitted or controversial: if admitted, no

                            arose. 'fake for example the following case. <quote>You killed a

                            insists with some vehemence on the view that the first place should be
                            given to some strong argument, but that the strongest should be reserved
                            to the end, while the weaker arguments should be placed in the middle,
                            since the judge has to be moved at the beginning and forcibly impelled
                            to a decision at the end. But with the defence it is different: </p>

                            should regard the defence of other points with disfavour. Sometimes,
                            however, this order is subject to alteration; for example if the minor
                            arguments are obviously false and the refutation of the most serious
                            argument a matter of some <pb n="v7-9 p.13"/> difficulty, we should
                            attack it last of all, after discrediting the prosecution by

                            with a view to connecting the arguments of the cases. Take the following

                                infancy, shall only take him back after paying for his keep. A

                                life-long acquaintance. The father, on the other hand, will urge
                                that his payment for his son's nurture has discharged the debt due

                                intervened, no violence was used and you make no complaint that the
                                jury was bribed, while there was no difficulty about proving his
                                guilt. What conclusion is left to us save that there was collusion?

                            arriving at the best by a process of elimination. Milo is accused of

                            that he killed him. The act must then have been either right or wrong.
                            We urge that it was right. If so, the act must have either been
                            deliberate or under <pb n="v7-9 p.27"/> compulsion of necessity, for it

                            unintelligent, surely the following argument will suggest itself:â
                                <quote> If the law bars the way, there is no ground for action and
                                the trial becomes a farce. But it is beyond question that the law
                                exists and that the uneducated son did commit the offence for which
                                it enacts a punishment. </quote> What then shall we say? <quote>I
                                had no education.</quote>

                        <p> But if the law applies to all men, it will be of no avail to plead lack
                            of education. We must therefore try to discover whether there be not
                            some point on which the law can be invalidated. We turn for guidance to
                            nature (a point on which I cannot insist too often); what does she
                            suggest save that when the letter of the law is against us, we should
                            discuss its intention? This introduces the general question whether we
                            are to stand by the letter or the spirit. But if we argue this question
                            on general grounds with reference to law in the abstract, we shall go on
                            for ever; it is a question that has never been decided. We must

                        <p> Let us pursue the matter further and see if we can discover any
                            additional arguments. How is that to be done? I am deliberately
                            imitating the actual train of thought of one <pb n="v7-9 p.39"/> who is
                            engaged in such an enquiry with a view to showing how such enquiry
                            should be conducted. I shall therefore put aside the more showy kind of
                            composition, and concern myself solely with such as may be of real
                            profit to the student. So far we have derived all our questions from the
                            character of the claimant. But why should we not make some enquiries
                            into the character of the father? Does not the law say that whoever
                            fails to appear for his father is to be disinherited? </p>

                            appear? Such a course is often adopted in those controversial themes in
                            which we demand that sons who fail to maintain their parents should be
                            cast into prison: take for example the case of the mother who gave
                            evidence against her son when accused of being an alien, or of the
                            father who sold his son to a procurer. What, then, is there in the
                            present case that we lay hold of as regards the character of the father?

                            us not despair. It is probable that the intention of the legislator was
                            that innocent parents should secure the support of their children. But
                            the uneducated son will be ashamed to produce this argument, since he

                        <p> There is, however, another line of argument which may be drawn from the

                            together with his advocate. It seems almost impossible that in one and
                            the same case a son should incur a penalty, <pb n="v7-9 p.41"/> both if
                            he appeared in his father's defence and if he did not appear. Further,
                            exiles are outlaws. Therefore the letter of the law cannot conceivably
                            apply to the advocate of the condemned man. </p>

                        <p> For how can an exile hold any property? The uneducated son raises a
                            doubt as to the interpretation both of the letter and the spirit of the
                            law. Tile eloquent son will cling to the strict letter of tile law,
                            which makes no exception, and will argue that the reason for enacting a
                            penalty against those who fail to appear for their fathers was to
                            prevent their being deterred from the defence of their fathers by the
                            risk of banishment, and he will assert that his brother failed to appear
                            in defence of his innocent father. It may therefore be worth while

                            about his portion of the inheritance. Still the time is not yet come to
                            relax our efforts: for so far all the arguments might have been used
                            even if the father had not been recalled from exile. But we must not
                            betake ourselves at once to the obvious point that he was recalled by
                            the agency of the uneducated son. A little ingenuity will lead us to
                            look further a field: for as <hi rend="italic">species</hi> comes after

                            else. This will give rise <pb n="v7-9 p.43"/> to a question of the
                            ratiocinative or syllogistic type, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            the sentence of the court and is tantamount to the trial never having
                            taken place at all. The uneducated son will therefore attempt to argue
                            that, being entitled to not more than one reward, there was no means by
                            which he could have secured the recall of his kin save by the
                            restoration of his father on the same terms as if he had never been
                            accused, and that this fact carries with it the cancellation of the
                            penalty incurred by his advocate, as though he had never defended his
                            father at all. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The reward to
                                be chosen, it is argued, covered the recall of one person only. The

                                be recalled was by the restoration of the father, whose amnesty

                        <p> Our next point will be that which first occurred to us, namely the plea
                            that he was recalled by the agency of the uneducated son. At this point
                            we are confronted by the question whether the son who secured his
                            father's restoration is thereby to be regarded in the light of an
                            advocate, since he secured for him precisely what his original advocate
                            demanded for him, and it is not an unreasonable claim to ask that an
                            action should be regarded as equivalent when it is really more than
                            equivalent. </p>

                        <p> The remaining points turn on questions of equity, for we ask which of
                            the two sons makes the juster claim. This question admits of still
                            further division. The claim of the uneducated son would have been the
                            juster even if both had claimed the whole property. How much more so
                            when one claims only a half and the other the whole to the exclusion of
                            his brother. And then, even after we have dealt with all these points,
                            an appeal to the memory of his father will carry great weight with the
                            judges, more especially as the dispute is about the father's estate.
                            This will give rise to conjecture as to what the intentions <pb n="v7-9 p.45"/> of the father were at the time of his dying
                            intestate. This conjecture, however, involves a question of <hi rend="italic">quality,</hi> and is employed in the service of a

                        <p> Concerning intentions there can be no questions which do not involve
                            some person and where the facts of the case are not admitted. Therefore
                            when the question turns on some fact, the point on which doubt arises is
                            either what has been done, or what is being done, or what is likely to
                            be done. For example, in general questions we discuss whether the
                            universe <hi rend="italic">has been</hi> formed of a concourse of atoms,
                            or <hi rend="italic">is</hi> governed by <pb n="v7-9 p.47"/> providence,
                            or <hi rend="italic">is likely</hi> some day to come to an end. In
                            definite questions, on the other hand, we discuss whether Roscius <hi rend="italic">has</hi> murdered his father, whether Manlius <hi rend="italic">is</hi> aiming at making himself king, or Quintus
                            Caecilius <hi rend="italic">will be</hi> justified in appearing as the

                        <p> In the law courts past time is of most importance, since all accusations
                            are concerned with what has actually been done, while what is being done
                            or is likely to be done is inferred from the past. We also enquire into
                            origins. For instance, we enquire whether a pestilence be due to the
                            anger of heaven, the inclement weather, the pollution of the
                            water-supply, or the noxious vapours emitted by the earth. Again, we
                            seek for the motives of an act. For example, we enquire whether the
                            fifty kings who sailed against Troy did so because they were bound by
                            their oath, or were moved to do so by righteous indignation, or merely
                            desired to gratify the sons of Atreus. There is no very great difference
                            between these two classes of question. </p>

                            cases, however, which consist of accusation and defence, there is one
                            kind of conjecture by which we enquire both about an act and about its
                            author. This sometimes treats the two questions together, as, for
                            example, when both the act and the identity of the author are denied,
                            and sometimes separately, as when the first enquiry, whether the act was
                            committed, is followed by a second, where, the act being admitted, the
                            question is by whom it was committed. </p>

                        <p> The act itself again sometimes involves a single question, as, for

                            as, for instance, whether he died of poison or of some internal disease.
                            Another form of conjecture is concerned with the act alone, it being
                            admitted that if the act was really committed, there can be no doubt as
                            to its author. A third form is concerned solely with the author, the act
                            being admitted and the dispute turning on the question as to who
                            committed it. This third form is complex. </p>

                            of transferring the charge to another. At times this results in <hi rend="italic">mutual accusation,</hi> which the Greeks call <foreign xml:lang="grc">á¼Î½ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ±ÏÎ·Î³Î¿ÏÎ¯Î±,</foreign> and some of our own authors

                            charge is transferred to some person who cannot be brought to trial, and
                            may be either known or unknown: again, if the person is known, he may be
                            someone outside the case or the victim himself, who may be alleged to
                            have committed suicide. </p>

                            the same way as in eases of mutual accusation. Cicero, for instance, in
                            the <hi rend="italic">pro Vareno</hi> diverts the charge from the
                            accused to the slaves of Ancharius and in the <hi rend="italic">pro

                        <p> There is also a different form of comparison, which comes into play when
                            both parties claim the credit of some act, and yet another kind, when
                            the question is not as between two persons, but as between two acts;
                            that is to say, the question is not which of the two committed an act,
                            but which of two acts was committed. Finally, if the act and the
                            identity of the author are both <pb n="v7-9 p.53"/> admitted, we may
                            still raise the question of his intention. I shall now proceed to
                            detail. As an example of joint denial covering both the act and the
                            identity of the author we may take the following statements, <quote>I
                                have not committed adultery,</quote>
                        <quote>I have not sought to
                                establish myself as tyrant.</quote> In cases of murder or poisoning
                            the denial is often divided as follows: </p>

                    <div n="12" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p>
                        <quote>The act was not committed, and, if it was committed, it was not by
                                me.</quote> But if the defence say, <quote>Prove that the man was
                                killed,</quote> the burden falls solely on the accuser, for the
                            accused can say nothing more against the charge except perhaps in the
                            way of casting certain suspicions, which he should throw out in the
                            vaguest terms, since if you make one definite assertion, you will have
                            to prove it or run the risk of losing your case. For when the question
                            lies between our statement and that of our opponent, one or other will
                            be regarded as true. Thus when the point on which we relied for our
                            defence is overthrown, there is nothing left but the points that tell
                            against us. </p>

                        <p> For example, when the question turns on symptoms, which may point either
                            to poisoning or internal disease, there is no third course left open and
                            consequently each party sticks to his statement. At times the question
                            turns on the nature of the fact, whether, for instance, death was due to
                            poisoning or internal disease, and arguments are introduced which are
                            drawn from the circumstances alone without any reference to the person

                            followed by his death. The age of the deceased is also an important
                            factor, and it is desirable to know whether he died suddenly or after a
                            long period of ill health. If the question turns only on his sudden
                            death, both parties will have still freer scope for discussion. </p>

                            the accused is or is not a likely person to have committed such an act.
                            When, on the other hand, the enquiry concerns both the accused and the
                            act, the natural order for the accuser to pursue is to commence by
                            proving that the act has been committed and then to go on to show that
                            it was committed by the accused. If, however, proofs of the authorship
                            of the crime are more in number than the proofs of the commission, this
                            order may be reversed. </p>

                            where the fact is admitted, and the only question is as to the author.
                            It is unnecessary for me to quote examples, since such cases are of
                            frequent occurrence. For example, it may be clear that a man has been
                            killed or that sacrilege has been committed, but the person accused of
                            the crime may deny his guilt. It is from such circumstances that cases
                            of mutual accusation arise, where it is admitted that the crime has been
                            committed, but each party charges the other with being the author. </p>

                            for the jury is empanelled to try one accused person only, and even

                            injure our opponent, while secondly, our accusation will carry greater
                            weight if we have first proved our own innocence, and thirdly, we shall
                            thus secure a double line of defence. For the man who says, <quote>I did

                            that of our adversary, or we may compare individual arguments. The
                            choice between these two methods can only be determined by the
                            requirements of the case. For example, in the <hi rend="italic">pro

                            individual arguments: for it would have been rash in connexion with the
                            second charge to compare the position of a stranger with that of a

                            courts. For example, the sole question in the case of Naevius of Arpinum

                            are concerned with rewards and may be illustrated by the following
                            controversial theme. <quote> A tyrant, suspecting that his physician had
                                given him poison, tortured him and, since he persisted in denying
                                that he had done so, sent for a second physician. The latter
                                asserted that poison had been administered, but that he would
                                provide an antidote; he gave him a draught: the tyrant drank it and
                                died. Both physicians claim a reward for slaying the tyrant.
                            </quote> Now just as in cases of mutual accusation where each party
                            shifts the guilt to his opponent, so in this <pb n="v7-9 p.63"/> case we
                            compare the characters, motives, means, opportunities, instruments and

                            followed is identical whether the case be one of accusation and defence
                            or of claim and denial of the claim. Conjecture is, in the first place,
                            based on what is past, under which I include persons, causes and intent.
                            For in dealing with a case we first ask what the accused intended to do,
                            next what he was in a position to do, and lastly what he actually did.
                            Consequently the first point on which we must fix our attention is the

                            is arraigned. For example, if he calls a man accused of murder a
                            debauchee or an adulterer, the discredit attaching to such charges will
                            no doubt tell against the accused, but will, on the other hand, do less
                            to prove the case than if he shows him to be bold, insolent, cruel or

                            times contradict each other, as for instance if a man accused of theft

                            grounds that it is incredible that a father has been killed by his son

                            may be pleaded in defence of the accused, or at times, on the other
                            hand, may be employed to prove his guilt on the ground that he trusted
                            to his rank to secure impunity. Similarly poverty, humble rank, wealth

                            motives, such as anger, hatred, fear, greed or hope, since all motives
                            can be classified as species of one or other of these. If any of these
                            motives can be plausibly alleged against the accused, it is the duty of
                            the accuser to make it appear that such motives may lead a man to commit
                            any crime, and to exaggerate the particular motives which he selects for
                            the purpose of his argument. </p>

                        <p> If no such motive can be alleged, he must take refuge in suggesting that
                            there must have been some hidden motive, or in asserting that, if he
                            committed the act, all enquiry into motive is irrelevant or that a
                            motiveless crime is even more abominable than one which has a motive.
                            Counsel for the defence, on the other hand, will, wherever it be
                            possible, emphasise the point that it is incredible that any act should
                            be committed without a motive. Cicero develops this point with great
                            energy in a number of his speeches, but more especially in his defence
                            of Varenus, who had everything else against him and was as a matter of
                            fact condemned. </p>

                            to the accused. For it is possible that a man may be quite ignorant of
                            motives imputed to him. He may not, for example, have known whether the
                            man whom he is accused of having killed had appointed him his heir or
                            intended to prosecute him. All else failing, we may urge that motives
                            are not necessarily of importance. For what man is there who is not
                            liable to the emotions of fear, hatred or hope, and yet numbers of
                            persons act on these motives without committing crime? </p>

                        <p> Nor should we neglect the point that all motives do not apply to all
                            persons. For example, although poverty may in certain cases be a motive
                            for theft, it will not have the same force with men such as Curius or
                            Fabricius. </p>

                        <p> The question has been raised as to whether we should deal first with
                            persons or motives, and different orators have given different answers:
                            Cicero as a rule prefers to treat motives first. For my own part, if the
                            circumstances of the case do not point strongly in either direction, I
                            consider that the most natural course is to begin by dealing with
                            persons. For the enquiry whether any crime can credibly be imputed to
                            such a man as the accused is of a more general character than the
                            question whether some one particular crime can be imputed, and in
                            addition involves a greater correctness in division. </p>

                            but also causes leading to error, such as drunkenness or ignorance. For
                            just as such considerations lessen the guilt of a crime when regarded
                            from the point of view of its quality, so they tell heavily against the
                            criminal as <pb n="v7-9 p.73"/> far as the question of fact is

                            actual case in the courts, in which neither side said anything about the
                            character of the persons involved; but this is not true of causes and
                            motives, for it is often wholly unnecessary to trouble ourselves about
                            them, as, for example, in cases of theft or adultery, crimes which carry

                            detection when committed, or that, even if detected, it would be

                            killed Clodius with impunity. There is also the question why the accused
                            should have chosen that particular place or time or means for the
                            commission of the crime, a topic to which Cicero gives a thorough
                            treatment in the same passage; </p>

                            (for it is a common saying that crimes are irrational), or finally,
                            whether he was led astray by the fact that crime had become a habit with
                            him. <pb n="v7-9 p.75"/> Having dealt with the question whether he
                            intended to commit the crime, we proceed to the question whether he was
                            in a position to commit it. Under this head we discuss the place and
                            occasion of the offence. For instance, in a case of theft we ask whether
                            it was committed in a secluded or frequented spot, in the daytime, when
                            witnesses are more numerous, or by night, when success is more
                            difficult. </p>

                        <p> Consequently we shall consider all the circumstances rendering the act
                            difficult or easy of accomplishment; these require no illustration,
                            being numerous and familiar. This second topic is of such importance
                            that, if it is impossible to give it satisfactory treatment, the case
                            falls to the ground; if, however, we succeed in dealing with it
                            adequately, we must proceed to consider whether the accused actually
                            committed the act. But this topic involves conjecture as to intention,
                            for it is from these facts that we infer whether he hoped for success or
                            not. Therefore we must also consider the question of the means at his
                            disposal, such, for example, as the retinues of Clodius and Milo. </p>

                            to time that is almost, though not actually contemporary: under this

                            with regard to deeds, it is sometimes from our own and sometimes from
                            those of others that we derive the greatest advantage, as, for example,
                            when our opponent has done something which tells in our favour: but our

                        <p> Finally, whereas our own words and deeds can only be justified by their
                            intention, the deeds and words of others can be disposed of in a number
                            of different ways. My remarks on this subject have, I think, been
                            confined to one very important class of conjectural cases, but something
                            of what I have said will apply to all cases. For example, in cases
                            concerned with <pb n="v7-9 p.79"/> theft, deposits and loans, arguments
                            are derived both from possibilities (as when we enquire whether there
                            was any money to deposit), and from persons, as when we raise the
                            question whether it is credible that anyone deposited money with this
                            man or trusted him with a loan, or that the claimant is bringing a false
                            accusation, or that the accused repudiates his debt or is a thief. </p>

                        <p> But even in the case of an accusation of theft, just as in an accusation
                            of murder, we enquire both into the act and the author, while in cases
                            concerned with loans and deposits there are also two questions (though
                            these are always distinct from one another), namely, whether the money
                            was delivered and whether it has been repaid. Cases of adultery are
                            marked by the following peculiarity, that, as a rule, the safety of two
                            persons is involved, and it is necessary to say something of the past
                            life of both, although some have raised the question whether both
                            parties should be defended together. The line to be taken must depend on
                            the circumstances of the individual case: if the defence of one party
                            lends support to the defence of the other, I should defend them
                            conjointly; if the reverse is the case, I should treat the two cases
                            separately. </p>

                            with the term to be applied, which depends on the letter of the law: it
                            is a form of question which can only arise in the courts from the actual
                            words on which the dispute turns. Take as examples the questions,
                            whether suicide is a form of homicide, or whether the man who forces a
                            tyrant to kill himself can be considered a tyrannicide, or whether
                            magical incantations are equivalent to the crime of poisoning. In all
                            these cases there is no doubt about the facts, for it is well known that
                            there is a difference between killing oneself and killing another,
                            between slaying a tyrant and forcing him to suicide, between employing
                            incantations and administering a deadly draught, but we enquire whether

                            whether one particular term is applicable to a given thing, as in the
                            question whether an act committed in a brothel is adultery. If we deny
                            that it is adultery, there is no need to state what it should be called,
                            since we have given a total denial to the charge. Secondly, there are
                            occasions when the question is which of two terms is to be applied to a
                            thing, as in the question whether an act is theft or sacrilege. It may
                            be sufficient for the defence that it is not sacrilege, but it is still
                            necessary to show what else it is, and therefore we must define both.

                        <p> Thirdly, there are times when the question concerns things which are
                            different in species, and we ask whether two different things are to be
                            called by the same name, in spite of the fact that each has a special
                            name of its own: for example, is tile same name applicable both to a

                            of this kind the question is whether one thing is another thing as well,
                            since the name in doubt does without question apply to something else.
                            It is sacrilege to steal a sacred object from a temple; is it also
                            sacrilege to steal private property from a temple? It is adultery to lie
                            with another man's wile in one's own house; is it adultery to do so in a
                            brothel? It is tyrannicide to slay a tyrant; is it tyrannicide to force

                            whether one thing has the same name as another, syllogism seeks to
                            determine whether one thing is to be regarded as identical with another.

                                in an appearance, and they raised a tomb to him and inscribed his
                                name thereon. His father on his return from overseas chanced to land
                                at this point of the shore, read the name and hung himself. It is

                                condemned forthwith. Were this so, the accuser, witnesses and judges
                                in a capital case would all be liable to condemnation. Nor is the
                                cause of death always a guilty cause. Take for instance the case of
                                a man who persuades another to go on a journey or sends for his
                                friend from overseas, with the result that the latter perishes in a
                                shipwreck, or again the case of a man who invites another to dine,
                                with the result that the guest dies of indigestion. <milestone n="34" unit="section"/> Nor is the act of the young men to be
                                regarded as the sole cause of death. The credulity of the old man
                                and his inability to bear the shock of grief were contributory
                                causes. Finally, had lie been wiser or made of sterner stuff, he
                                would still be alive. Moreover the young men acted without the least
                                thought of doing harm, and the father might have suspected from the
                                position of the tomb and the traces of haste in its construction
                                that it was not a genuine tomb. What ground then is there for
                                condemning them, for everything else that constitutes homicide is
                                lacking save only the contributory act? </quote>

                            quality we sometimes use the word in its most general sense, which
                            covers a number of different questions. For we enquire sometimes into
                            the nature and form of things: as for instance whether the soul is
                            immortal or whether god is to be conceived of in human form. Sometimes,
                            on the other hand, the question turns on size and number, as, for
                            instance, what is the size of the sun or whether there are more worlds
                            than one. In all these cases we arrive at our conclusions by conjecture,
                            yet each involves a question of quality. </p>

                        <p> Such questions are sometimes treated in deliberative themes: for
                            example, if Caesar is deliberating whether to attack Britain, he must
                            enquire into the nature of the Ocean, consider whether Britain is an
                            island (a fact not then ascertained), and estimate its size and the
                            number of troops which lie will require for the invasion. Under the same
                            head of quality fall questions whether certain things should be done or
                            not and certain objects sought or avoided: such topics are specially
                            adapted for deliberative themes, but occur with some frequency in
                            controversial themes as well, the only difference being that in the
                            latter we deal with what is past and in the former with the future. </p>

                            with rewards or penalties or their quantity. The case is therefore of
                            two kinds, simple or comparative, the former dealing with what is just,
                            the latter with what is juster, or most just. When the point for
                            decision is the penalty to be inflicted, the duty of the pleader will be
                            to defend, extenuate or excuse the act on which the charge is based, or
                            even, according to some, to plead for mercy. </p>

                        <p> By far the strongest line that can be taken in defence is to assert that
                            the act which forms the subject of the charge is actually honourable. A
                            man is disinherited because he went on military service, stood for

                                this form of defence which turns not on the facts, but on the
                                justice of the case. The meaning of <hi rend="italic">ad intellectum

                                be that the defence turns not on the act, but on its significance
                                and equity. If any change is made in the text, the simplest course
                                is to delete the words as a gloss which has crept into the text.

                        <p> For example, in a suit concerned with the question of disinheritance a
                            father may, without reflecting on himself, say to his sons that his act
                            was of importance to his own interests, and the same plea may be urged
                            by a husband accused of cruelty by his wile or a son who alleges that
                            his father is insane. But in such cases the position of the man who
                            seeks to avoid loss is stronger than that of him who aims at positive
                            advantage. </p>

                        <p> Precisely similar methods are also employed in questions that occur in
                            real life. For the scholastic themes concerned with the disowning of
                            children are on exactly the same footing as the cases of sons
                            disinherited by their parents which are tried in the public courts, or
                            of those claims for the recovery of property which are tried in the
                            centum viral court: themes dealing with cruelty find an actual parallel

                            and the question is whose fault it was that led to the divorce: and
                            again the theme where the son accuses his father of madness has its
                            analogy in cases where a suit is brought for the appointment of a
                            guardian. </p>

                            something worse. For in a comparison of evils the lesser evil must be
                            regarded as a positive good: for example, Mancinus may defend the treaty
                            made with the Numantines on the ground that it saved the army from
                            annihilation. This form of defence is called <foreign xml:lang="grc">á¼Î½ÏÎ¯ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¹Ï</foreign> by the Greeks, while we style it defence by
                            comparison. </p>

                        <p> Such are the methods by which we may <pb n="v7-9 p.113"/> defend an act.
                            If it is impossible to defend an act either on its merits or with the
                            assistance of arguments from without, the next best course will be to
                            shift the charge, if possible, to another. It is for this reason that
                            the <hi rend="italic">basis</hi> of <hi rend="italic">competence</hi>
                            has been held to apply even to those who cannot plead the letter of the

                           <hi rend="italic">i e.</hi> there are no legal grounds for alleging

                            then, the blame will be thrown on a person: for example, Gracchus, when
                            accused of making the treaty with the Numantines (and it was fear of
                            this accusation that seems to have led him to bring forward the
                            democratic laws of his tribuneship) may plead that he made it as the
                            representative of his commander-in-chief. </p>

                        <p> At times, on the other hand, the blame may be shifted to some thing: for
                            instance, a person who has failed to comply with some testamentary
                            injunction may plead that the laws forbade such compliance. The Greek

                            If these methods of defence are out of the question, we must take refuge
                            in making excuses. We may plead ignorance. For example, if a man has
                            branded a runaway slave and the latter is subsequently adjudged to be a
                            free man, he may deny that he was cognisant of the truth. Or we may
                            plead necessity; for instance, if a soldier overstays his leave, he may
                            plead that his return was delayed by floods or ill health. </p>

                            intentions. Instances of these two latter forms of excuse are, however,
                            so numerous and obvious that there is no need for me to cite them here.

                            for mercy have a legitimate place. In such cases there are three points
                            based on the circumstances of the accused which are most effective. The
                            first is drawn from his previous life, if he has been blameless in his
                            conduct and deserved well of the state, or if there is good hope that
                            his conduct will be blameless for the future and likely to be of some
                            use to his fellow men; the second is operative if it appears that he has
                            been sufficiently <pb n="v7-9 p.117"/> punished already on the ground
                            that he has suffered other misfortunes, or that his present peril is
                            extreme, or that he has repented of his sin; while thirdly we may base
                            his appeal on his external circumstances, his birth, his rank, his
                            connexions, his friendships. </p>

                        <p> It is, however, on the judge that we shall pin our highest hopes, if the
                            circumstances be such that acquittal will result in giving him a
                            reputation for clemency rather than for regrettable weakness. But even
                            in the ordinary courts appeals for mercy are frequently employed to a
                            large extent, although they will not colour the whole of our pleading.
                            For the following form of division is common:â <quote>Even if he had
                                committed the offence, he would have deserved forgiveness,</quote> a
                            plea which has often turned the balance in doubtful cases, while
                            practically all perorations contain such appeals. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div n="20" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> Sometimes indeed the whole case may rest on such considerations. For
                            example, if a father has made an express declaration that he has
                            disinherited his son because lie was in love with a woman of the town,
                            will not the whole question turn on the point whether it was the
                            father's duty to pardon such an offence and whether it is the duty of
                            the centumviral court to overlook it? Nay, even in penal prosecutions
                            governed by strict forms of law we raise two separate questions: first
                            whether the penalty has been incurred, and secondly whether, if so, it
                            ought to be inflicted. Still the view of the authorities to whom I have
                            referred that an accused person cannot be saved from the clutches of the
                            law by this method of defence is perfectly correct. </p>

                        <p> With regard to rewards, there are two questions which confront us:
                            namely, whether the claimant is <pb n="v7-9 p.119"/> deserving of any
                            reward, and, if so, whether he deserves so great a reward. If there are
                            two claimants, we have to decide which is the more worthy of the two; if
                            there are a number, who is the most worthy. The treatment of these
                            questions turns on the kind of merit possessed by the claimants. And we
                            must consider not merely the act (whether it has merely to be stated or
                            has to be compared with the acts of others), but the person of the
                            claimant as well. For it makes a great difference whether a tyrannicide
                            be young or old, man or woman, a stranger or a connexion. </p>

                            always been free? was he killed in the citadel or in his own house? The
                            means, too, and the time call for consideration: was he killed by poison
                            or the sword? was he killed in time of peace or war, when he was
                            intending to lay aside his power or to venture on some fresh crime? </p>

                        <p> Further, in considering the question of merit, the danger and difficulty
                            of the act will carry great weight, while with regard to liberality it
                            will similarly be of importance to consider the character of the person
                            from whom it proceeds. For liberality is more pleasing in a poor man
                            than in a rich, in one who confers than in one who returns a benefit, in
                            a father than in a childless man. Again, we must consider the immediate
                            object of the gift, the occasion and the intention, that is to say,
                            whether it was given in the hope of subsequent profit; and so on with a
                            number of similar considerations. The question of <hi rend="italic">quality</hi> therefore makes the highest demands on the resources
                            of oratory, since it affords the utmost scope for a display of talent on

                            eloquence is to demonstrate <hi rend="italic">quality:</hi> there lies
                            its kingdom, there its power, and there its unique victory. Verginius

                        <p> Disinheritance may be of two kinds. In the first case it is for a
                            completed crime: for example, the son who is disinherited may be a
                            ravisher or an adulterer: in the second case it is for a crime which is
                            still incomplete and terminable <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Literally <hi rend="italic">conditional.</hi>
                                The sense, however, is that the disinheritance is only conditional
                                on the disobedience being continued. </note> ; an instance of this
                            will be the case where the son is disinherited because of disobedience
                            to his father. The first form of disinheritance always demands a certain
                            harshness when the father pleads his case, since the act is irrevocable,
                            whereas in the latter his pleading will be of a kindly and almost
                            persuasive nature, since he would prefer not to disinherit him. On the
                            other hand, the pleading of the sons should in both cases be of a
                            subdued character and couched in a conciliatory tone. </p>

                            for pardon. For these are domestic quarrels, in which the fact that the

                            Such discussions fall into two classes, according as the point in
                            dispute arises from an argument advanced by the prosecution or from some

                            is whether the demurrer can stand. Still, wherever possible, we should
                            attempt to create a favourable impression in the judge as to the facts
                            of the case as well, since, if this be done, he will be all the more
                            disposed to give an indulgent hearing <pb n="v7-9 p.135"/> to our point
                            of law: for example, in actions taking the form of a wager and arising

                                stolen 10,000 sesterces. 40,000 are claimed from each. They claim

                            the accused will urge that the sum which they offer to pay is fourfold.
                            The intention of the law will be pleaded by both parties. </p>

                        <p> On the other hand, the dispute may turn on a passage of the law which is

                            Here there is no doubt about the son of one who was a prostitute before
                            his birth, but it is doubtful whether the law applies to the case of one
                            born before his mother became a prostitute. </p>

                            the same dispute, the problem being whether the word <hi rend="italic">twice</hi> refers to the prosecutor or the prosecution. Such are
                            the points arising out of the obscurity of the law. A second form of
                            question turns on some passage where the meaning is clear. Those who
                            have given exclusive attention to this class of question call it the <hi rend="italic">basis concerned with the obvious expression of the law

                            first comes into play where it is clear that it is impossible always to
                            observe the letter of the law. <quote>Children shall support their
                                parents under penalty of imprisonment.</quote> It is clear, in the
                            first place, that this cannot apply to an infant. At this point we shall
                            turn to other possible exceptions and distinguish as follows. <quote>
                                Does this apply to everyone who refuses to support his parent? Has
                                this particular individual incurred the penalty by this particular

                        <p> The second arises in scholastic themes where no argument can be drawn
                            from the particular law, but the question is concerned solely with the
                            subject of the dispute. <quote> A foreigner who goes up on to the wall
                                shall be liable to capital punishment. The enemy had scaled the wall
                                and were driven back by a foreigner. His punishment is demanded.
                            </quote>

                    </div>
                    <div n="7" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> In this case we shall not have two separate questions, namely, whether
                            every foreigner who goes up on the wall is liable to the penalty, and
                            whether this particular foreigner is liable, since no more forcible
                            argument can be brought against the application of the letter of the law
                            than the fact in dispute, but the only question to be raised will be
                            whether a foreigner may not go on to the wall even for the purpose of
                            saving the city. Therefore we shall rest our case on equity and the
                            intention of the law. It is, however, sometimes possible to draw
                            examples from other laws to show that we cannot always stand by the
                            letter, as Cicero did in his defence of Caecina. </p>

                            provide an example. <quote> Anyone who is caught at night with steel in

                            case the use of the word <hi rend="italic">caught</hi> is sufficient
                            proof that the word steel was only intended by the law in the sense of a
                            weapon of offence. </p>

                            the letter of the law must also seek to gain support from the intention.
                            Again, in cases concerned with wills it sometimes happens that the
                            intention of the testator is clear, though it has not been expressed in
                            writing: an example of this occurs in the trial of Curius, which gave
                            rise to the well-known argument between Lucius Crassus and Scaevola.

                            recently. A man who had made a bequest of 5000 sesterces, on altering

                            For all writers of text-books are agreed that in such cases there are
                            two <hi rend="italic">bases</hi> involving the letter and the intention
                            of the law respectively. This view is justified by the fact that, when
                            one law contradicts another, both parties attack the letter and raise
                            the question of intention, while the point in dispute, as regards each
                            law, is whether we should be guided by it at all. </p>

                        <p> But it is clear to everybody that one law cannot contradict another in
                            principle (since if there were two different principles, one law would
                            cancel the other), and that the laws in question are brought into
                            collision purely by the accidents of chance. When two laws clash, they
                            may be of a similar nature, as for instance if we have to compare two
                            cases in which a tyrannicide and a brave man are given the choice of
                            their reward, both being granted the privilege of choosing whatever they
                            desire. In such a case we compare the deserts of the claimants, the
                            occasions of the respective acts and the nature of the rewards claimed.

                                A magistrate shall not quit the citadel. One who has rendered heroic
                                service to his country may choose what reward he pleases. A
                                magistrate who left his post and saved his country, demands an

                            no other law covering the case, we may raise the question whether a hero
                            ought to be granted anything he chooses to claim. Again, many conclusive
                            arguments may be brought against the letter of the law restricting the
                            movements of the magistrate: for example, a fire may have broken out in
                            the citadel, or a sally against the enemy may have been necessary. </p>

                            contravention, as for example in the case of the hero and the deserter

                            whole law is ignored, whereas, if he be put to death, the hero will
                            still have another choice left open to him. It is, however, of the
                            utmost importance to consider which course is best from the point of
                            view of morality and justice, a problem for the solution of which no
                            general rules can be laid down, as it will depend on the special

                            that which is lawful with regard to a part, lawful with regard to the
                            whole? Example: <quote>It is forbidden to export wool from Tarentum: he

                        <p> In all these cases the syllogism rests on the letter of the law as well:
                            for the accuser urges that the provisions of the law are precise. He
                            will say, <quote>I demand that the priestess who has broken her vows be

                        <p> But to this we may reply, <quote> The law does not prescribe that the

                                should exercise her choice under all circumstances, that the

                            and to argue because that is the case, so also is this. Take the
                            following problems. <quote>The man who kills his father shall be sewn up

                            the letter of the law? Now it should be noted that what is similar may
                            be greater, equal or less. In the first ease we enquire whether the
                            provisions of the law are sufficient, or, if they are insufficient,
                            whether we should have recourse to this other law. In both cases it is a

                            making them the subject for controversial themes, as, for example, in

                            led by degrees; whether we should refute our opponent's arguments as a
                            whole or in detail; whether we should reserve emotional appeals for the
                            peroration or distribute them throughout the whole speech; whether we
                            should speak first of law or of equity; whether we should first advance
                            (or refute) charges as to past offences or the charges connected with
                            the actual trial; </p>

                            our speech, and what reserved for a later stage. This gift of
                            arrangement is to oratory what generalship is to war. The skilled
                            commander will know how to distribute his forces <pb n="v7-9 p.171"/>
                            for battle, what troops he should keep back to garrison forts or guard
                            cities, to secure supplies, or guard communications, and what

                            he can acquire eloquence merely by the labour of others. He must burn
                            the midnight oil, persevere to the end and grow pale with study: he must
                            form his own powers, his own experience, his own methods: he must not

                            use, as though they were born with him and not derived from the

                            greatest care in writing text-books of rhetoric have been the furthest
                            removed from genuine eloquence. Still, it is absolutely necessary to
                            point out to beginners the road which they should follow, though this
                            road must be smooth and easy not merely to enter, but to indicate.
                            Consequently, our skilful instructor should select all <pb n="v7-9 p.179"/> that is best in the various writers on the subject
                            and content himself for the moment with imparting those precepts of
                            which he approves, without wasting time over the refutation of those
                            which he does not approve. For thus your pupils will follow where you
                            lead. </p>

                            other road than that on which we have set their feet, and it may be left
                            to time to teach them what is actually the best. It is true that writers
                            on rhetoric have, by the pertinacity with which they have defended their
                            opinions, made the principles of the science which they profess somewhat
                            complicated; but these principles are in reality neither obscure nor

                            mentioned, the necessary rules are but few in number, and if the pupil
                            gives them ready acceptance, he will find that the path to further

                            speaking well, that it is useful, and further, that it is an art and a
                            virtue. I wished also to show that its subject matter consists of
                            everything on which an orator may be called to speak, and is, as a rule,
                            to be found in three classes of oratory, demonstrative, deliberative,

                            argument falling under the head of instruction, while emotional appeals
                            are concerned with moving the audience and, although they may be
                            employed throughout the case, are most effective at the beginning and
                            end. As to the element of charm, I pointed out that, though it may
                            reside both in facts and words, its special sphere is that of style.

                            the other definite, and involving the consideration of persons and
                            circumstances of time and place; further, that whatever our subject
                            matter, there are three questions which we must ask, <hi rend="italic">is it? what is it?</hi> and <hi rend="italic">of what kind is

                            praise and denunciation, and that in this connexion we must consider not
                            merely the acts actually performed by the person of whom we were
                            speaking, but what happened after his death. This task I showed to be

                            subject of deliberation is possible or likely to happen. At this point I
                            emphasised the importance of considering who it is that is speaking,
                            before whom he is speaking, and what he says. As regards forensic cases,
                            I demonstrated that some turn on one point of dispute, others on
                            several, and <pb n="v7-9 p.183"/> that whereas in some cases it is the
                            attack, in others in is the defence that determines the <hi rend="italic">basis;</hi> that every defence rests on denial, which
                            is of two kinds, since we may either deny that the act was committed or
                            that its nature was that alleged, while it further consists of
                            justification and technical pleas to show that the action cannot stand.

                            mentioned above, states that lie has seen many good, but no really
                            eloquent speakers, and holds that, while to be a good speaker it is
                            sufficient to say what is necessary, only the really eloquent speaker
                            can do this in ornate and appropriate language. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            that the reason why they and their predecessors lacked this gift was its
                            extreme difficulty of acquisition. Again, Cicero <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Cic. <hi rend="italic">Or.</hi> xiv. 44;
                            </note> holds that, while invention and arrangement are within the reach
                            of any man of good sense, eloquence belongs to the orator alone, and
                            consequently it was on the rules for the cultivation of eloquence that
                            he expended the greatest care. </p>

                            the actual term, but on the meaning of the term, and must be tested by

                            used occurs when there are a number of things all called by the same
                            name: in this case the original term from which the others are derived
                            is styled the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> term. <pb n="v7-9 p.201"/>
                            For example, the word <hi rend="italic">vertex</hi> means a whirl of
                            water, or of anything else that is whirled in a like manner: then, owing
                            to the fashion of coiling the hair, it comes to mean the top of the
                            head, while finally, from this sense it derives the meaning of the
                            highest point of a mountain. All these things may correctly be called
                                <hi rend="italic">vertices,</hi> but the <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> use of the term is the first. So, too, <hi rend="italic">solea</hi> and <hi rend="italic">tuidus</hi>

                        </note> The third kind of <hi rend="italic">propriety</hi> is found in the case where a thing
                            which serves a number of purposes has a special name in some one
                            particular context; for example, the proper term for a funeral <hi rend="italic">song</hi> is <hi rend="italic">naenia,</hi> and for
                            the general's <hi rend="italic">tent augurale.</hi> Again, a term which
                            is common to a number of things may be applied in a <hi rend="italic">proper</hi> or special sense to some one of them. Thus we use <hi rend="italic">urbs</hi> in the special sense of Rome, <hi rend="italic">venales</hi> in the special sense of newly-purchased

                            things which may be styled <hi rend="italic">venales</hi> besides
                            slaves, and gold and silver are found at Corinth as well as bronze. But
                            the use of such terms implies no special excellence in an orator. </p>

                            more important to note that such seemly ornament must be varied to suit
                            the nature of the material to which it is applied. To begin with the

                            suit demonstrative, deliberative and forensic speeches. For the oratory
                            of display aims solely at delighting the audience, and therefore
                            develops all the resources of eloquence and deploys all its ornament,
                            since it seeks not to steal its way into the mind nor to wrest the
                            victory from its opponent, but aims solely at honour and glory. </p>

                            of both cases. For although tile canon, that clearness mainly requires

                            But as a general rule it may be laid down that the best words,

                            in sound. Again, elegant words are always to be preferred to those which
                            are coarse, and there is no room for low words in the speech of a

                            another, and words which are all too mean to describe great things may
                            be suitable enough when applied to subjects of less importance. And just

                            intrinsic value of their own. On the other hand, there is no word which

                            avoid obscenity on the ground that no word is indecent in itself and

                        <p> Let us now pass to consider connected discourse. Its adornment may be
                            effected, primarily, in two ways; that is to say, we must consider first
                            our ideal of style, and secondly how we shall express this ideal in
                            actual words. The first essential is to realise clearly what we wish to
                            enhance or attenuate, to express with vigour or calm, in luxuriant or
                            austere language, at length or with conciseness, with gentleness or
                            asperity, magnificence or subtlety, gravity or wit. </p>

                            we desire. But, before I discuss ornament, I must first touch upon its
                            opposite, since the first of all virtues is the avoidance of faults.

                            defined by Cicero <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            polish, which are essential parts of ornament, but that excess is always

                            to which perverted usage has given an obscene meaning: take, for
                            example, phrases such as <hi rend="italic">ductare exercitus and patrare

                        <p> still it is one to be avoided, for we have perverted the purity of

                            give ground before the victorious advance of vice. The same term is also
                            applied in the cases where an unfortunate collocation of words produces
                            an obscene suggestion. For example, in the phrase <hi rend="italic">cum

                            letter of the first syllable, which cannot be pronounced without closing
                            the lips, will force us either to pause in a most unbecoming manner, or
                            by assimilation to the <hi rend="italic">n</hi> which follows <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                            of Hirtius when he said that a child had been carried for ten months in
                            his mother's womb. <quote>Oh,</quote> he said, <quote>I suppose other

                            improper or redundant words, in obscurity of meaning, effeminacy of
                            rhythm, or in the childish search for similar or ambiguous expressions.

                            to be avoided, but which are hard to distinguish from virtues. </p>

                            found in the actual word employed to describe a thing. For example, we

                                restraint to the winds, makes wealth an excuse for luxury, and
                                strong passions for playing the harlot, would this be a reason for
                                my regarding a man who was somewhat free in his method of saluting
                                her to be an adulterer? </quote>

                            ornament which many regard as the chief, nay, almost the sole adornment

                        <p>V. When the ancients used the word <hi rend="italic">sententia,</hi> they meant a feeling, or opinion. The word is
                            frequently used in this sense by orators, and traces of this meaning are
                            still found even in the speech of every day. For when we are going to
                            take an oath we use the phrase <hi rend="italic">ex animi nostri
                                sententia (in</hi> accordance with what we hold is the solemn
                            truth), and when we offer congratulations, we say that we do so <hi rend="italic">ex sententia</hi> (with all our heart). The ancients,
                            indeed, often expressed the same meaning by saying that they uttered
                            their <hi rend="italic">sensa;</hi> for they regarded <hi rend="italic">senses</hi> as referring merely to the senses of the body. </p>

                            our own. Accordingly, I think that I ought to say something of the

                            called <foreign xml:lang="grc">Î³Î½ÏÎ¼Î·</foreign> by the Greeks. Both the
                            Greek and the Latin names are derived from the fact that such utterances
                            resemble the decrees or resolutions of public bodies. The term, however,
                            is of wide application (indeed, such reflexions may be deserving of
                            praise even when they have no reference to any special context), and is
                            used in various ways. Sometimes it refers merely to things, as in the
                            sentence: <quote> There is nothing that wins the affections of the

                            their production flatter their authors by a superficial semblance of
                            wit. Take, for instance, the exclamation from the scholastic theme,
                            where a man, after being ruined by the barrenness of his land, is
                            shipwrecked and hangs himself: <quote>Let him whom neither earth nor sea

                            discuss a point of more importance. Rhetoricians are divided in opinion
                            on this subject: some devote practically all their efforts to the

                            throw objects into relief, and consequently artists who include a number
                            of objects in the same design separate them by intervals sufficient to
                            prevent one casting a shadow on the other. Further, </p>

                            should be made from the methods of Cato and the Gracchi? And yet before
                            the Gracchi and Cato the style of oratory was simpler still. </p>

                            see the whole body full of eyes, for fear that it might cripple the

                            example of a necessary metaphor I may quote the following usages in
                            vogue with peasants when they call a vinebud <hi rend="italic">gemma,</hi> a gem (what other term is there which they could use?),
                            or speak of the <hi rend="italic">crops being thirsty</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">fruit suffering.</hi> For the same reason we speak of
                            a <hi rend="italic">hard</hi> or <hi rend="italic">rough</hi> man, there
                            being no <hi rend="italic">literal</hi> term for these temperaments.

                            occupy a place already vacant, or if it fills the room of something
                            else, should be more impressive than that which it displaces. </p>

                            number are employed. </p>

                            Oratory makes frequent use of such allegory, but generally with this
                            modification, that there is an admixture of plain speaking. We get
                            allegory pure and unadulterated in the following passage of Cicero:
                                <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">From an unknown

                        <p> The following is an example of the commonest type, namely, the mixed

                        <quote> I always thought that Milo
                                would have other storms and tempests to weather, at least in the
                                troubled waters of political meetings. </quote> Had he not added the

                                meetings,</quote> we should have had pure allegory: their addition,
                            however, converted it into a mixed allegory. In this type of allegory
                            the ornamental element is provided by the metaphorical words and the
                            meaning is indicated by those which are used literally. </p>

                                with their wild ebb and flow? The passing of one day, or the
                                interval of a single night, will often throw everything into
                                confusion, and one little breath of rumour will sometimes turn the
                                whole trend of opinion. <milestone n="50" unit="section"/>

                            For it is all-important to follow the principle illustrated by this
                            passage and never to <pb n="v7-9 p.331"/> mix your metaphors. But there
                            are many who, after beginning with a tempest, will end with a fire or a
                            falling house, with the result that they produce a hideously incongruous

                        <p> For the rest, allegory is often used by men of little ability and in the

                            novelty and change that please in oratory, and what is unexpected always
                            gives special delight. Consequently we have thrown all restraint to the
                            wind in such matters, and have destroyed the charm of language by the
                            extravagant efforts which we have made to attain it. </p>

                        <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The allusion must be to the fact that Dionysius

                                to Corinth and set up as a schoolmaster. Its application is
                                uncertain, but it would obviously be a way of saying <quote>How are

                            view of the fact that lucidity is a virtue; nevertheless they are used

                            theirs to another to which they do not properly belong. A <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi> on the other hand, as is clear from the

                            and <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> are often combined in the expression
                            of the same thought, since figures are introduced just as much by the

                            what is meant by a <hi rend="italic">figure.</hi> For the term is used
                            in two senses. In the first it is applied to any form in which thought
                            is expressed, just as it is to bodies which, whatever their composition,
                            must have some shape. </p>

                            analogous to that involved by sitting, lying down on something or
                            looking back. Consequently when a student tends <pb n="v7-9 p.355"/> to
                            continuous or at any rate excessive use of the same cases, tenses,
                            rhythms or even feet, we are in the habit of instructing him to vary his
                                <hi rend="italic">figures</hi> with a view to the avoidance of

                            If we are content with this view, there is good reason for the opinion
                            expressed by Apollodorus (if we may trust the statement of Caecilius on
                            this point) to the effect that he found the rules laid down in this

                            seems to me, a middle course. For he does not hold that all forms of

                            especially striking and most effective in stirring the emotions of the
                            audience. He sets forth this view in two of his works, and that my

                                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/> For great effect may be
                                produced by dwelling on a single point, and by setting forth our
                                facts in such a striking manner that they seem to be placed before
                                the eyes as vividly as if they were taking place in our actual
                                presence. This is especially effective in stating a case or for the
                                purpose of illuminating and amplifying the facts in course of
                                statement, with a view to making our audience regard the point which
                                we amplify as being as important as speech can make it. <milestone n="28" unit="section"/> On the other hand, as opposed to this
                                procedure we may often give a rapid summary, suggest more than is
                                actually said, may express ourselves tersely in short, clean-cut
                                sentences and disparage, or, what is much the same, mock our

                                propose to say, mark off the topics already treated from those which
                                are to follow, return to our point, repeat it and draw our formal

                                the force of some point, we may exaggerate and overstate the truth:
                                we may ask questions, or, what is much the same, enquire of others
                                and set forth our own opinion. There is also available the device of
                                dissimulation, when we say one thing and mean another, the most
                                effective of all means of stealing into the minds of men and a most
                                attractive device, so long as we adopt a conversational rather than
                                a controversial tone. <milestone n="30" unit="section"/> Hesitation
                                may be expressed between two alternatives, our statement may be

                                after we have said something or when we repel some allegation
                                against ourselves. We may defend ourselves by anticipation to secure
                                the success of some point which we propose to make or may transfer
                                the blame for some action to another. We may confer with our
                                audience, admitting them as it were into our deliberations, may
                                describe the life and character of persons either with or without
                                mention of their names, a device which is one of the greatest
                                embellishments of oratory and specially adapted to conciliate the
                                feelings, as also frequently to excite them. <milestone n="31" unit="section"/> Again by the introduction of fictitious
                                personages we may bring into play the most forcible form of
                                exaggeration. We may describe the results likely to follow some
                                action, introduce topics to lead our hearers astray, move them to
                                mirth or anticipate the arguments of our opponent. Comparisons and
                                examples may be introduced, both of them most effective methods; we
                                may divide, interrupt, contrast, suppress, commend. <milestone n="32" unit="section"/> Our language may be free or even
                                unbridled with a view to heighten our effects, <pb n="v7-9 p.367"/>
                                while anger, reproach, promises that we shall prove our case,
                                entreaty, supplication, slight deviations from our proposed course
                                (which must be distinguished from the longer digressions mentioned
                                above), exculpation, conciliation, personal attacks, wishes and
                                execrations are all of value. <milestone n="33" unit="section"/> The
                                above include practically all the devices of thought which may be
                                employed for the adornment of our speech. As regards diction, this
                                may either be employed like weapons for menace and attack, or
                                handled merely for the purpose of display. For example, sometimes
                                the repetition of words will produce an impression of force, at
                                other times of grace. Again, slight changes and alterations may be
                                made in words, the same word may be repeated sometimes at the
                                beginning of a sentence and sometimes at the end, or the sentence
                                may be made to open and close with the same phrase. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> This appears to be the

                                    Cicero in <hi rend="italic">Orator</hi> 135 as occurring when we
                                    pass something by and show why we do so. <hi rend="italic">reprehensio</hi> means correction of the expression as
                                    opposed to the correction of thought referred to above. For the

                                however, more important. They are so frequently employed by
                                Demosthenes that some critics have held that it is in them that the
                                chief beauty of his style resides. And in truth there is hardly a
                                topic in his speeches which is not distinguished by some artificial
                                treatment of the thought, and it must be admitted that speaking
                                involves the embellishment of all, or at any rate most of our
                                thoughts with some form of ornament. <milestone n="41" unit="section"/> As you, Brutus, have such an admirable
                                knowledge of all these methods, it would be waste of time for me to
                                cite all their names or to give illustrations. I shall therefore
                                content myself merely with indicating this topic. Our ideal orator
                                then will speak in such a manner that he will cast the same thought
                                into a number of different forms, will dwell on one point and linger
                                over the same idea. <milestone n="42" unit="section"/> he will often
                                attenuate some one point or deride his opponent, will diverge from
                                his theme and give a bias to his thought, will set forth what he
                                intends to say, after completing his argument will give a brief
                                summary, will <pb n="v7-9 p.373"/> recall himself to the point which
                                he has left, repeat what he has said, complete his proof by a formal
                                conclusion, embarrass his opponent by asking questions or answer
                                himself in reply to imaginary questions; <milestone n="43" unit="section"/> will desire his words to be taken in a
                                different sense from their literal meaning, will hesitate what
                                argument or form of statement to prefer, will classify and divide,
                                will deliberately omit and ignore some point, and defend himself by
                                anticipation; will transfer the blame of some charge brought against
                                him to his opponent, will often take his audience, and sometimes
                                even his opponent into consultation, <milestone n="44" unit="section"/> will describe the character and talk of
                                particular persons, will put words into the mouths of inanimate
                                objects, divert the minds of the audience from the point at issue,
                                often move them to merriment or laughter, anticipate objections,
                                introduce comparisons, cite precedents, assign and distribute
                                different sentiments to different persons, silence interrupters,
                                assert that there are certain things of which he prefers not to
                                speak, warn his audience to be on their guard against certain
                                things, or venture on a certain licence of speech. Again, he will
                                wax angry, sometimes indulge in rebuke, entreaty or supplication,
                                will clear away unfavourable impressions, swerve a little from his
                                point, utter wishes or execrations, or address his audience in terms
                                of familiar intimacy. <milestone n="45" unit="section"/> There are
                                also other virtues at which he should aim, such as brevity, if his
                                theme demands it, while he will often set forth topics in such vivid
                                language as almost to present them to the very eyes of his audience,
                                or will exaggerate his subject beyond the bounds of possibility. His
                                meaning will frequently be deeper than his words seem to <pb n="v7-9 p.375"/> indicate, his tone will often be cheerful, and
                                he will often mimic life and character. In fact, as regards this
                                department of oratory, of which I have given you the substance, lie
                                must display eloquence in all its grandest forms. </quote>

                            to digress from and return to his theme, to divert the blame from
                            himself and transfer it to another, or to decide what points to omit and
                            what to ignore as negligible? It is qualities such as these that give
                            life and vigour to oratory; without them it lies torpid like a body

                            is a form of <hi rend="italic">confession,</hi> such as he introduces in

                            we find indirect speeches in the historians, as at the opening of Livy's

                            in their ignorance of the facts may regard some point as of more
                            importance than it really is: an example of this latter device is to be

                            class of figure which is of the commonest occurrence and on which I
                            think I shall be expected to make some comment. It is one whereby we
                            excite some suspicion to indicate that our meaning is other than our
                            words would seem to imply; but our meaning is not in this case contrary
                            to that which we express, as is the case in <hi rend="italic">ironq,</hi> but rather a hidden meaning which is left to the hearer
                            to discover. As I have already pointed out, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">IX. i. 14.</note> modern rhetoricians
                            practically restrict the name of <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> to this
                            device, from the use of which <hi rend="italic">figured</hi>
                            controversial themes derive their name. </p>

                        <p> This class of figure may be employed under three conditions: first, if
                            it is unsafe to speak openly; secondly, if it is unseemly to speak
                            openly; and thirdly, when it is employed solely with a view to the
                            elegance of what we say, and gives greater pleasure by reason of the
                            novelty and variety thus introduced than if our meaning had been
                            expressed in straightforward language. </p>

                        <p> The first of the three is of common occurrence in the schools, where we
                            imagine conditions laid down by tyrants on abdication and decrees passed
                            by the senate after a civil war, and it is a capital offence to accuse a
                            person with what is past, what is not <pb n="v7-9 p.417"/> expedient in
                            the courts being actually prohibited in the schools. But the conditions
                            governing the employment of figures differ in the two cases. For we may
                            speak against the tyrants in question as openly as we please without
                            loss of effect, provided always that what we say is susceptible of a
                            different interpretation, since it is only danger to ourselves, and not
                            offence to them, that we have to avoid. </p>

                            hand, the actual business of the courts has never yet involved such
                            necessity for silence, though at times they require something not unlike
                            it, which is much more embarrassing for the speaker, as, for example,
                            when he is hampered by the existence of powerful personages, whom he
                            must censure if he is to prove his case. </p>

                            since the actual manner in which offence is given is a matter of
                            indifference, and if a figure is perfectly obvious, it ceases to be a
                            figure. Therefore such devices are absolutely repudiated by some
                            authorities, whether the meaning of the figure be intelligible or not.

                        <p> I myself have come across persons whom it was impossible to convince by
                            other means: I have even come across a much rarer thing, namely, a case
                            which could only be proved by recourse to such devices. I was defending
                            a woman who was alleged to have forged her husband's will, and the heirs
                            were stated to have given a bond <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The bond was to the effect that they would make
                                over the property to the wife; the existence of such a bond proved
                                the wife innocent, since it was a virtual confirmation of the will,
                                of which it showed the husband to have cognisance. But the bond was
                                not valid in the eye of the law and such <hi rend="italic">tacita
                                    fideicommissa</hi> were illegal, since the wife could not
                                inherit; consequently the admission of the existence of the bond
                                would have involved the loss of the inheritance, which on
                                information being laid (cp. <hi rend="italic">delatores</hi> ) would
                                have lapsed to the state. <hi rend="italic">Caput</hi> is the civil
                                status of the wife. With regard to <hi rend="italic">dicebantur,</hi> the writing is careless, as it suggests that
                                the statement was made by the prosecution, which was, of course, not
                                the case. </note> to the husband on his deathbed, which latter
                            assertion was true. </p>

                            transferred to her by a secret conveyance in trust. Now it was easy for
                            me to secure the woman's acquittal, by openly mentioning the existence
                            of the bond; but this would have involved her loss of the inheritance. I
                            had, therefore, to plead in such a way that the judges should understand
                            that the bond had actually been given, but that informers might be
                            unable to avail themselves of any statement of mine to that effect. And

                            that I wished to demonstrate that there was room for the employment of

                                his father's pardon as a reward. The father opposes his choice.

                                that he would be condemned. His father gave evidence in his defence,
                                stating that the murder had been committed on his orders. The son
                                was acquitted, but disinherited by the <pb n="v7-9 p.431"/> father.
                            </quote> For in this case he does not pardon his son entirely, but
                            cannot openly withdraw the evidence that he gave in the first trial, and
                            while he does not inflict any worse penalty than disinheritance, he does
                            not shrink from that. Further, the employment of the <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> tells more heavily against the father than is fair and
                            less against the son. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> The
                                sense is quite uncertain. The simplest interpretation is perhaps
                                that the father's action and the <hi rend="italic">figura</hi> by
                                which he defends himself show that his evidence in the previous
                                trial was false. The son has been acquitted on the father's
                                evidence, and the father by punishing him has put himself in a
                                hopelessly false position. </note>

                            the ground. If, on the other hand, he holds out no hope of pardon,
                            though he will not necessarily be regarded as mad, he will certainly
                            give the impression of cruelty and will prejudice the judge against him.

                            unpleasing facts. Themistocles, for example, is believed to have urged

                            to urge them to abandon it would have been too brutal an expression.

                            to indicate one thing by allusion to another; take the case where a
                            rival candidate speaks against an ex-tyrant who had abdicated on
                            condition of his receiving an amnesty <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> An example of this theme is preserved in the
                                elder Seneca, Excerpt. controv. 5, 8. One candidate is permitted to
                                speak against another. A tyrant has abdicated on condition of an
                                amnesty and that any one who charged him with having been a tyrant
                                should be liable to capital punishment. The ex-tyrant stands for a
                                magistracy. The rival candidate speaks against him. The irony is in
                                the last sentence. </note> : <quote> I am not permitted to speak

                        <p> Another common device is to introduce an oath, like the speaker who, in

                            effect when he said that oaths were for the witness and not for the
                            advocate. Again, the advocate who drags in an oath merely for the sake
                            of some trivial rhetorical effect, does not deserve much credit, unless

                            main classes. One is defined as the form of language, while the other is
                            mainly to be sought in the arrangement of words. Both are equally
                            applicable in oratory, but we may style the former rather more
                            grammatical and the latter more rhetorical. <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> These grammatical figures would not be styled

                            The former originates from the same sources as errors of language. For
                            every <hi rend="italic">figure</hi> of this kind would be an error, if

                            often express the active by the passive form, as in the case of <hi rend="italic">arbitror</hi> (think) and <hi rend="italic">suspicor</hi> (suspect), and the passive by the active, as in the
                            case of <hi rend="italic">vapulo</hi> (am beaten). Consequently the
                            interchange of the two forms is of common occurrence, and in many cases
                            either form can be used: for example, we may say <hi rend="italic">luxuriatur</hi> or <hi rend="italic">luxuriat</hi> (luxuriate), <hi rend="italic">fluctuatur</hi> or <hi rend="italic">fluctuat</hi>

                        <p> Sometimes, as I remarked in connexion with the doubling of words, the beginnings and the conclusions of sentences are made to correspond
                            by the use of other words with the same meaning. Here is an example of
                            correspondence between the beginnings: <quote> I would have faced every
                                kind of danger; I would have exposed myself to treacherous attacks;
                                I would have delivered myself over to public hatred. </quote>

                            of conclusions is provided by another passage in the same speech which
                            follows close on that just cited: <quote>For you have decided; you have

                            correct. For the words are differentiated, but their meaning is
                            identical. Sometimes, again, words of the same meaning are grouped
                            together. For instance, <quote> Since this is so, Catiline, proceed on
                                the path which you have entered; depart from the city, it is high
                                time. The gates are open, get you forth. </quote>

                        <p> There is a third class of <hi rend="italic">figures</hi> which attracts
                            the ear of the audience and excites their attention by some resemblance,
                            equality or contrast of words. To this class belongs <hi rend="italic">paronomasia,</hi> which we call <hi rend="italic">adnominatio.</hi>
                            This may be effected in different ways. It may depend on the resemblance
                            of one word to another which has preceded, although the words are in
                            different cases. Take the following passage from Domitius Afer's defence
                            of Cloatilla: <hi rend="italic">Mulier omnium rerum imiperita, in

                            declined, and does not always occur at the end of a sentence; the
                            correspondence may occur at the beginning, middle or <pb n="v7-9 p.493"/> end of clauses, or may be varied so that the middle of one clause
                            corresponds with the beginning of another and the end with the middle:
                            in fact, any arrangement of correspondences is permissible. </p>

                            immovable rigidity should as far as possible restrict itself to the

                            welding together in artistic form the disconnected words and phrases

                            of their study, as far at least as the rudeness of their attainments
                            permitted. For even Cicero for all his greatness will never persuade me
                            that Lysias, Herodotus and Thucydides were careless in this respect.

                            never have done to spoil the fine and delicate texture of Lysias by the
                            introduction of richer rhythms, since he would thus have lost all that
                            surpassing grace which he derives from his simple and unaffected tone,
                            while he would also have sacrificed the impression of sincerity which he
                            now creates. For it must be remembered that he wrote his speeches for
                            others to deliver, so that it was right that they should suggest a lack
                            of form and artistic structure: indeed his success in producing this
                            effect actually shows his mastery of structure. </p>

                            true that in the speeches inserted by historians we may note something
                            in the way of balanced cadences and antitheses. As regards Herodotus,
                            while his flow, in my opinion, is always gentle, his <pb n="v7-9 p.517"/> dialect has such a sweetness of its own that it even seems to contain

                            essential if correctness of structure is to be attained. There are then
                            in the first place two kinds of style: the one is closely welded and
                            woven together, while the other is of a looser texture such as is found
                            in dialogues and letters, except when they deal with some subject above

                            analyse. For dialogues and letters do not demand continual <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi> between vowels or absence of rhythm, but
                            on the other hand they have not the flow or the compactness of other

                            in conjunction. Words taken singly are known as <hi rend="italic">asyndeta</hi> (unconnected). In dealing with them we must take care
                            that our style does not diminish in force through the fact that a weaker
                            word is made to follow a stronger: as, for example, if after calling a
                            man a despoiler of temples we were to speak of him as a thief, or after
                            styling him a highwayman were to dub him an insolent fellow. For
                            sentences should rise and grow in force: of this an excellent example is
                            provided by Cicero, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                           <hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi> II. xxv. 63. </note> where he says,

                                would do credit to a prizefighter, in every limb of your body

                            scarcely have gone on to speak of his lungs and throat without an
                            anticlimax. There is also another species of order which may be entitled

                            unpleasing effects of sound will be produced by the juxtaposition of the
                            same long vowels, while the worst <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi> occurs

                            short vowels. And in all conjunctions of vowels, the resulting sound
                            will be proportionately soft or harsh according as they resemble or

                            there is good reason for the view that all the followers of Isocrates
                            and more especially Theopompus pay accessive attention to the avoidance

                                    pronounce it. If, instead of closing the lips all that were done
                                    were to drop the uvula, a nasal sound would be given to the
                                    following initial vowel, so that <hi rend="italic">fine
                                        onerat</hi> would be pronounced <hi rend="italic">finewonerat</hi> with a nasalized o. </quote> Lindsay, <hi rend="italic">Lat. Langu.</hi> p. 62. It is this sound which
                                Quintilian describes as almost the sound of a new letter. </note>

                            Consequently the one seems to be concerned with quantity and the other

                            while even boys are well aware that a long syllable is equivalent to two

                            is half as long again as the other, as is the case with <hi rend="italic">paeanic</hi> rhythm (a <hi rend="italic">paean</hi>

                            followed by one long or with any other arrangement preserving the
                            proportion of three beats to two) or finally one part of the foot may be
                            twice the length of the other, as in the case of the <hi rend="italic">iambus,</hi> which is composed of a short followed by a long, or of

                            long; for rhythm merely takes into account the measurement of the time,

                            being the same. The measure of verse on the other hand is quite
                            different; the <hi rend="italic">anapaest</hi> (u u _) or <hi rend="italic">spondee</hi> (_ _) cannot be substituted at will for
                            the <hi rend="italic">dactyl,</hi> nor is it a matter of indifference

                        <p> This fact is clearly understood by Cicero, who frequently shows that the
                            sense in which he desires that prose should be rhythmical is rather that
                            it should not lack rhythm, a deficiency which would stamp the author as
                            a man of no taste or refinement, than that it should be tied by definite
                            rhythmical laws, like poetry; just as, although we may not wish certain
                            persons to be professional gymnasts, we still do not wish them to be

                            even Cicero was not free, I ask my reader, whenever I speak of the
                            rhythm of artistic structure (as I have done on every occasion), to

                            the less I should allow the orator to select certain words for their

                            those of the alternative words. He may also be permitted to add words,

                            not essential to the sense, while he may employ figures to alter case

                            verse, first because there are but few feet in a single line of verse
                            which is far shorter than the lengthy periods of prose; secondly because
                            each line of verse is always uniform and its movement is determined by a
                            single definite scheme, whereas the structure of prose must be varied if
                            it is to avoid giving offence by its monotony and standing convicted of

                            feet are composed. Its presence is, however, most necessary and most
                            apparent at the conclusion of the period, firstly because every group of
                            connected thoughts has its natural limit and demands a reasonable

                            and being carried along down the stream of oratory, finds its best
                            opportunity of forming a sound judgement on what it has heard, when the

                            which claims the most care: for the audience have their attention fixed

                                This theory involves the allotment of a time-value to consonants:
                                    <hi rend="italic">gres</hi> gives the time-value of <hi rend="italic">gr</hi> to <hi rend="italic">a,</hi> and itself

                                This view is more explicitly expressed by the fifth-century
                                grammarian Pompeius (112. 26k), who allots the value of half a
                                time-length to each consonant. Therefore to Ä (= one time-length)
                                are added the two half time-lengths represented by <hi rend="italic">gr</hi> (see Lindsay, <hi rend="italic">Lat. Language,</hi> p.

                            be regarded as one foot, if indeed a foot consisting of two <hi rend="italic">chorei</hi> can be considered as a single foot. </p>

                                opening of a sentence, it cannot be supposed that he commends this
                                employment of the <hi rend="italic">pyrrhic.</hi> He mentions it
                                only to illustrate another method of forming the <hi rend="italic">paean</hi> (e.g. <hi rend="italic">multa bene</hi> ) by two
                                words, the first a <hi rend="italic">chores,</hi> the second a <hi rend="italic">pyrrhic.</hi> His view about the employment of
                                this form of <hi rend="italic">paean</hi> is that it is sometimes
                                used at the end, but that such a position is not advisable. </note>
                            But all these feet which end in short syllables will lack the stability
                            required for the cadence, and should as a rule only be employed in cases
                            where speed is required and there is no marked pause at the ends of the

                        <p> Prose-structure, of course, existed before rhythms were discovered in
                            it, just as poetry was originally the outcome of a natural impulse and
                            was created by the instinctive feeling of the ear for quantity and the
                            observation of time and rhythm, while the discovery of feet came later.
                            Consequently assiduous practice in writing will be sufficient to enable
                            us to produce similar rhythmical effects when speaking extempore. </p>

                            as the poet in writing a verse considers the metre as a whole, and does
                            not concentrate his attention on the six or five individual feet that
                            constitute the verse. For poetry originated before the laws which govern
                            it, a fact which explains Ennius' statement <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> Enn. <hi rend="italic">Ann.</hi> 213. </note>

                            which appreciates fullness of rhythm or feels the lack of it, is
                            offended by harshness, soothed by smooth and excited by impetuous

                        <p> The answer is that in such cases we must rely on feeling. It is possible

                            for severity or charm, but yet to produce the required effect better by
                            taking nature for our guide in place of art: none the less there will
                            always be some principle of art underlying the promptings of nature.

                            the different kinds of rhythm. There are two points which call for
                            consideration if he is to do this with success. The one is concerned
                            with feet, the other with the general rhythm of the period which is
                            produced by their combination. I will deal with the latter first. We

                            sonority as well. On the other hand, passages of an opposite character,
                            such as those in which we argue, distinguish, jest or use language
                            approximating to colloquial speech, are better served by short

                            which it exemplifies should be forced on all <hi rend="italic">exordia.</hi> For there are various ways in which the <pb n="v7-9 p.583"/> judge's mind may be prepared for what is to come:
                            at times we appeal for pity, at others take up a modest attitude, while
                            we may assume an air of energy or dignity, flatter our audience, attempt
                            to alter their opinions and exhort them to give us their best attention,
                            according as the situation may demand. And as all these methods are
                            different by nature, so each requires a different rhythmical treatment.

                            kinds of feet should, as far as possible, be intermixed. For while the

                            will be best secured by the employment of the <hi rend="italic">iambus,</hi> not merely because that foot contains but two
                            syllables, with the result that its beat is more frequent, making it
                            unsuited to gentle language, but also because every foot gives the
                            effect of an ascent, as they climb and swell from short to long, a fact
                            which renders them superior to the <hi rend="italic">choreus,</hi> which

                            beginning, the points which come first in time will, as our training
                            proceeds, become of quite trivial importance. Now we have reached a
                            stage in our enquiry where we are no longer considering the preliminary
                            training of our orator; for I think the instructions already given
                            should suffice for that; they are in any case as good as I could make
                            them. Our present task is to consider how our athlete who has learnt all
                            the technique of his art from his trainer, is to be prepared by actual
                            practice for the contests in which he will have to engage. Consequently,
                            we must assume that our student has learned how to conceive and dispose
                            his subject matter and understands how to choose and arrange his words,
                            and must proceed to instruct him how to make the best and readiest use
                            of the knowledge which he has acquired. </p>

                            resources, to be employed whenever they may be required. The resources
                            of which I speak consist in a copious supply of words and matter. </p>

                            all and every case. Now, if there were special <pb n="v10-12 p.7"/> words
                            adapted to each individual thing, they would require less care, since
                            they would automatically be suggested by the matter in hand. But since
                            some words are more literal, more ornate, more significant or euphonious
                            than others, our orator must not merely be acquainted with all of them,
                            but must have them at his fingers' ends and before his very eyes, so
                            that when they present themselves for his critical selection, he will

                        <p> I know that some speakers make a practice of learning lists of synonyms

                            once present itself to them, and that if, after using one word, they
                            find that it is wanted again after a brief interval, they may be able to
                            select another word with the same meaning and so avoid the necessity of
                            repetition. But this practice is childish and involves thankless labour,
                            while it is really of very little use, as it merely results in the
                            assembly of a disorderly crowd of words, for the speaker to snatch the

                            by which things are to be called, but when each particular word is most

                            For in everything which we teach examples are more effective even than
                            the rules which are taught in the schools, so long as the student has
                            reached a stage when he can appreciate such examples without the

                            to win glory for its author. Consequently, to avoid monotony of
                            narrative, it employs unusual words and indulges in a freer use of

                            My design is merely to select a few of the most eminent authors for

                            for there would be no point in such a comparison, as I consider that

                        <p> I regard the excellences of these two orators as being for the most part

                            difference. Demosthenes is more concentrated, Cicero more diffuse;
                            Demosthenes makes his periods shorter than Cicero, and his weapon is the
                            rapier, whereas Cicero's periods are longer, and at times he employs the
                            bludgeon as well: nothing can be taken from the former, nor added to the
                            latter; the Greek reveals a more studied, the Roman a more natural art.

                            largely due to him that Cicero was able to attain greatness. For it
                            seems to me that Cicero, who devoted himself heart and soul to the
                            imitation of the Greeks, succeeded in reproducing the force of
                            Demosthenes, the copious flow of Plato, and the charm of Isocrates. </p>

                            of their teachers, painters the works of their predecessors, and

                            more often the result of imitation. But the very fact that in <pb n="v10-12 p.77"/> every subject the procedure to be followed is so

                            good or bad in virtue of their inherent nature (for in themselves they
                            are no more than mere sounds), but solely in virtue of the aptitude and
                            propriety (or the reverse) with which they are arranged, while
                            rhythmical composition must be adapted to the theme in hand and will

                            presents itself; we must first criticise the fruits of our imagination,
                            and then, once approved, arrange them with care. For we must select both
                            thoughts and words and weigh them one by one. This done, <pb n="v10-12 p.95"/> we must consider the order in which they should be

                        <p> Julius Florus, the leading orator of Gaul, for it was there that he

                            nephew. He once noticed that Secundus, who was still a student, was
                            looking depressed, and asked him the meaning of his frowns. The youth

                            to write, with the result that he was not only vexed over his immediate
                            difficulty, but had lost all hope of future success. Florus smiled and
                            said, <quote>Do you really want to speak better than you

                            permit. For to make any real advance we need study, not selfaccusation.
                            And it is not merely practice that will enable us to write at greater
                            length and with increased fluency, although doubtless practice is most
                            important. We need judgement as well. So long as we do not he back with

                            but turn our thoughts to consider what the circumstances of the case
                            demand, what suits the characters involved, what is the nature of the
                            occasion and the temper of the judge, we shall acquire the power of
                            writing by rational means. It is thus that nature herself bids us begin

                            the more shameful if it is simply the result of education. We must not,

                            preference. The latter, however, although of assistance to the eye,
                            delays the hand and interrupts the stream of thought owing to the

                            reason for the view that erasure is quite as important a <pb n="v10-12 p.111"/> function of the pen as actual writing. Correction
                            takes the form of addition, excision and alteration. But it is a

                            excised. On the other hand, to prune what is turgid, to elevate what is
                            mean, to repress exuberance, arrange what is disorderly, introduce
                            rhythm where it is lacking, and modify it where it is too emphatic,
                            involves a twofold labour. For we have to condemn what had previously

                            handiwork; for thus we may prevent ourselves from regarding our writings

                            all, must be set to correction. For there are some who return to

                            own orators, on the ground that, since all the best expressions have

                            since the young orator crams all the flowers of eloquence which belong
                            to all the different portions of the theme into that portion which he
                            has to deliver, and fearing to lose what should naturally come later,
                            introduces wild confusion into the earlier portions of his speech. </p>

                        <p> Having dealt with writing, the next point which claims our attention is
                            premeditation, which itself derives force from the practice of writing
                            and forms an intermediate stage between the labours of the pen and the
                            more precarious fortunes of improvisation; indeed I am not sure that it
                            is not more frequently of use than either. For there are places and
                            occasions where writing is impossible, while both are available in
                            abundance for premeditation. For <pb n="v10-12 p.129"/> but a few hours'
                            thought will suffice to cover all the points even of cases of
                            importance; if we wake at night, the very darkness will assist us, while
                            even in the midst of legal proceedings our mind will find some vacant
                            space for meditation, and will refuse to remain inactive. </p>

                            our matter without any recourse to writing, which in itself is no small
                            achievement, but will also set the words which we are going to use in
                            their proper order, and bring the general texture of our speech to such
                            a stage of completion that nothing further is required beyond the
                            finishing touches. And as a rule the memory is more retentive of
                            thoughts when the attention has not been relaxed by the fancied security
                            which results from committing them to writing. But the concentration

                            engaged in premeditation. Secondly, we must gradually acquire the habit

                        <p> If, however, some brilliant improvisation should occur to us while
                            speaking, we must not cling superstitiously to our premeditated scheme.
                            For premeditation is not so accurate as to leave no room for happy
                            inspiration: even when writing we often insert thoughts which occur to
                            us on the spur of the moment. Consequently this form of preparation must
                            be conceived on such lines that we shall find no difficulty either in
                            departing from it or returning to it at will. </p>

                        <p> For, although it is essential to bring with us into court a supply of
                            eloquence which has been prepared in advance in the study and on which
                            we can confidently rely, there is no greater folly than the rejection of
                            the gifts of the moment. Therefore our premeditation should be such that
                            fortune may never be able to fool us, but may, on the contrary, be able
                            to assist us. This end will be obtained by developing the power of
                            memory so that our conceptions may flow from us without fear of
                            disaster, and that we may be enabled to look ahead without anxious
                            backward glances or the feeling that we are absolutely dependent on what
                            we can call to mind. Otherwise I prefer the rashness of improvisation to
                            the coherence given by premeditation. </p>

                            subject on which we are speaking. And even if we are to rely on our
                            memory and our subject alike, there are more things that may be

                            powers of writing to other branches of literature. For it is scarcely

                            reply fail us and the whole aspect of the case undergoes <pb n="v10-12 p.135"/> a sudden change; consequently the variation to
                            which cases are liable makes it as necessary for us to change our

                            improvisations may reproduce the tone of our writing, and after writing

                            their vines, which run close to the surface of the soil, that the

                            survive. These memoranda, however, of which I am speaking are so
                            carefully drawn up that they seem to me to have been composed by himself

                            summaries of what we propose to say, even in cases where we have already
                            written it out in full. For reliance on such notes as these makes us
                            careless in learning what we have written and mutilates and deforms our
                            style. For my own part I think that we should never write out anything
                            which we do not intend to commit to memory. For if we do, our thoughts
                            will run back to what we have elaborated in writing and will not permit

                            judge, and what effects we should aim at in different parts of our
                            speech. Thus we shall eschew antique, metaphorical and newly-coined

                            chosen for saying anything is at least as important a consideration as
                            what is actually said. But the whole of this question of appropriate
                            language turns on something more than our choice of style, for it has
                            much in common with invention. For if words can produce such an
                            impression, how much greater must that be which is created by the facts
                            themselves. But I have already laid down rules for the treatment of the

                            expedient, but also what it is becoming to say. I am well aware that
                            these two considerations generally go hand in hand. For whatever is
                            becoming is, as a rule, useful, and there is nothing that does more to
                            conciliate the good-will of the judge than the observance or to alienate

                            expediency must yield to the demands of what is becoming. Who is there
                            who does not realise that nothing would have contributed more to secure
                            the acquittal of Socrates than if he had employed the ordinary forensic
                            methods of defence and had conciliated the minds of his judges by
                            adopting a submissive tone and had devoted his attention to refuting the

                            the penalty to which he might be sentenced as the highest of honours.
                            The wisest of men preferred to sacrifice the remnant of his days rather
                            than to cancel all his past life. And since he was but ill understood by
                            the men of his own day, he reserved his case for the approval of
                            posterity and at the cost of a few last declining years achieved through
                            all the ages life everlasting. </p>

                            offered him a written defence, he refused to make use of it, since,
                            though he recognised its excellence, he regarded it as unbecoming to
                            himself. This instance alone shows that the end which the orator must
                            keep in view is not persuasion, but speaking well, since there are
                            occasions when to persuade would be a blot upon his honour. The line
                            adopted by Socrates was useless to secure his acquittal, but was of real
                            service to him as a man; and that is by far the greater consideration.

                            boasting are a mistake, above all, it is an error for an orator to
                            praise his own eloquence, and, further, not merely wearies, but in the
                            majority of cases disgusts the audience. </p>

                        <p> For there is ever in the mind of man a certain element of lofty and
                            unbending pride that will not brook superiority: and for this reason we
                            take delight in raising the humble and submissive to their feet, since
                            such an act gives us a consciousness of our <pb n="v10-12 p.165"/>
                            superiority, and as soon as all sense of rivalry disappears, its place
                            is taken by a feeling of humanity. But the man who exalts himself beyond
                            reason is looked upon as depreciating and showing a contempt for others
                            and as making them seem small rather than himself seem great. </p>

                        <p> As a result, those who are beneath him feel a grudge against him (for

                            their own are always liable to this failing), while his superiors laugh
                            at him and the good disapprove. Indeed, as a rule, you will find that
                            arrogance implies a false self-esteem, whereas those who possess true
                            merit find satisfaction enough in the consciousness of possession.
                            Cicero has been severely censured in this connexion, although he was far
                            more given to boasting of his political achievements than of his
                            eloquence, at any rate, in his speeches. </p>

                            Catiline, or was replying to attacks made upon him by those who envied
                            his position; attacks which he was so far unable to withstand that he
                            suffered exile as the penalty for having saved his country.
                            Consequently, we may regard his frequent reference to the deeds
                            accomplished in his consulship as being due quite as much to the
                            necessities of defence as to the promptings of vainglory. </p>

                            his opponent's eloquence than exalted his own, and asserted that he had

                            of some other character. And yet I am not sure that open boasting is not
                            more tolerable, owing to its sheer straightforwardness, than that
                            perverted form of self-praise, which makes the millionaire say that he

                            others. I do not mean to deny that there are occasions when an orator
                            may speak of his own achievements, as Demosthenes himself does in his

                            should be most rigorously maintained. For there can be no doubt, that in

                            should express his grief at his father's affliction; and, however grave

                                curator, etc. </note> And this he should do not merely in a few
                            brief words, but his emotion should colour his whole speech, so that it
                            may be felt not merely that he is speaking, but that he is speaking the

                            because in such cases it makes the greatest difference what the point
                            may be and what the manner in which the mother seeks to injure her son.

                            he makes it clear that it was not merely right, but a positive necessity

                            odium which we incur or even transfer it to a different quarter, while

                            plead against such persons in a tone which we ourselves should have

                        </note> gives an example of such
                            moderation in the way in which he deals with Atratinus in his defence of

                            like a father. For Atratinus was of noble birth and young, and the
                            grievance which led him to bring the accusation was not unreasonable.
                            But the task is comparatively easy in those cases in which it is to the
                            judge, or even, it may be, to our audience that we have to indicate the
                            reason for our moderation. The real difficulty arises when we are afraid

                            further that there was an additional reason against his son's conduct,

                            his father with his marriage and his mother with the hard necessity of
                            her former life, nor give a bad example to his own children in their

                            essentially dependent on the laws of Sulla, that their repeal would
                            inevitably involve its destruction. Thus he succeeded in creating the

                            passage <note anchored="true" place="unspecified"> See <hi rend="italic">Or.</hi> xxviii. 97. </note> he says that his aim was not to

                            principle of memory. For our whole education depends upon memory, and we

                            while it is the power of memory alone that brings before us all the

                            return to us after it has been lost? But we should never have realised
                            the fullness of its power nor its supernatural capacities, but for the
                            fact that it is memory which has brought oratory to its present position

                            athletes, to celebrate the achievement of one who had gained the crown
                            for boxing. Part of the sum for which he had contracted was refused him
                            on the ground that, following the common practice of poets, he had
                            introduced a digression in praise of Castor and Pollux, and he was told
                            that, in view of what he had done, he had best ask for the rest of the
                            sum due from those whose deeds he had <pb n="v10-12 p.219"/> extolled. And

                            invited, by a message to the effect that two youths who had ridden to
                            the door urgently desired his presence. He found no trace of them, but
                            what followed proved to him that the gods had shown their gratitude.

                            realise by practical experiment. For when we return to a place after
                            considerable absence, we not merely recognise the place itself, but
                            remember things that we did there, and recall the persons whom we met
                            and even the unuttered thoughts which passed through our minds when we

                            that there shall be no delay in finding any single detail, since an idea
                            which is to lead by association to some other idea requires to be fixed

                            whether we should learn by heart in silence; it would be best to do so,
                            save for the fact that under such circumstances the mind is apt to
                            become indolent, with the result that other thoughts break in. For this
                            reason the mind should be kept alert by the sound of the voice, so that
                            the memory may derive assistance from the double effort of speaking and
                            listening. But our voice should be subdued, rising scarcely above a

                            the process of learning will be slower, because the perception of the
                            eye is quicker than that of the ear, while, on the other hand, when we
                            have heard a passage once or twice, we shall be in a position to test
                            our memory and match it against the voice of the reader. It is, indeed,
                            important for other reasons to test ourselves thus from time to time,
                            since continuous reading has this drawback, that it passes over the
                            passages which we find hard to remember at the same speed as those which

                            to consult his manuscript, since such practices merely encourage
                            carelessness, and no one will ever realise that he has not got his theme

                            obvious that he has written it. On the other hand, a good memory will
                            give us credit for quickness of wit as well, by creating the impression

                            awkward hesitation or even a tongue-tied silence. It is, therefore, far
                            safer to secure a good grasp of the facts themselves and to leave

                            speaking extempore. But if both memory and this gift be lacking, I
                            should advise the would-be orator to abandon the toil of pleading
                            altogether and, if he has any literary capacity, to betake himself by
                            preference to writing. But such a misfortune will be of but rare

                            that we cannot hope to attain perfection unless nature is assisted by
                            study. But I will not be so obstinate as to deny that to nature must be
                            assigned the first place. </p>

                            delivery. For we may employ a good, strong voice as we will; whereas one
                            that is ugly or feeble not only prevents us from producing a number of
                            effects, such as a <hi rend="italic">crescendo</hi> or a sudden <hi rend="italic">fortissimo,</hi> but at times forces faults upon us,
                            making us drop the voice, alter its pitch and refresh the hoarseness of
                            the throat and fatigue of the lungs by a hideous chanting intonation.
                            However, let me now turn to consider the speaker on whom my precepts

                        <p> All delivery, as I have already said, is concerned with two different
                            things, namely, voice and gesture, <pb n="v10-12 p.251"/> of which the one
                            appeals to the eye and the other to the ear, the two senses by which all
                            emotion reaches the soul. But the voice has the first claim on our
                            attention, since even our gesture is adapted to suit it. The first point
                            which calls for consideration is the nature of the voice, the second the
                            manner in which it is used. The nature of the voice depends on its
                            quantity and quality. </p>
                    </div>
                    <div n="15" type="textpart" subtype="section">
                        <p> The question of quantity is the simpler of the two, since as a rule it
                            is either strong or weak, although there are certain kinds of voice
                            which fall between these extremes, and there are a number of gradations
                            from the highest notes to the lowest and from the lowest to the highest.
                            Quality, on the other hand, presents more variations; for the voice may
                            be clear or husky, full or thin, smooth or harsh, of wide or narrow
                            compass, rigid or flexible, and sharp or flat, while lung-power may be
                            great or small. </p>

                        <p> It is not necessary for my purpose to enquire into the causes which give
                            rise to these peculiarities. I need not raise the question whether the
                            difference lies in those organs by which the breath is produced, or in
                            those which form the channels for the voice itself; whether the voice
                            has a character of its own or depends on the motions which produce it;
                            whether it be the strength of the lungs, chest or the vocal organs
                            themselves that affords it most assistance, since the co-operation of
                            all these organs is required. For example, it is not the mouth only that
                            produces sweetness of tone; it requires the assistance of the nostrils
                            as well, which carry off what I may describe as the overflow of the
                            voice. The important fact is that the tone must be agreeable and not
                            harsh. </p>

                        <p> The methods of using the <pb n="v10-12 p.253"/> voice present great
                            variety. For in addition to the triple division of accents into sharp,
                            grave and circumflex, there are many other forms of intonation which are
                            required: it may be intense or relaxed, high or low, and may move in
                            slow or quick time. </p>

                            of features, yet possesses infinite variety of expression, so it is with
                            the voice: for though it possesses but few varieties to which we can
                            give a name, yet every human being possesses a distinctive voice of his
                            own, which is as easily distinguished by the ear as are facial
                            characteristics by the eye. </p>

                        <p> The good qualities of the voice, like everything else, are improved by
                            training and impaired by neglect. But the training required by the
                            orator is not the same as that which is practised by the singing-master,
                            although the two methods have many points in common. In both cases
                            physical robustness is essential to save the voice from dwindling to the
                            feeble shrillness that characterises the voices of eunuchs, women and
                            invalids, and the means for creating such robustness are to be found in
                            walking, rubbing-down with oil, abstinence from sexual intercourse, an
                            easy digestion, and, in a word, in the simple life. </p>

                            or squeaky. For just as the sound produced in the pipe by the same
                            volume of breath varies according as the stops are closed or open, or
                            the instrument is clogged or cracked, so the voice is strangled if the
                            throat be swollen, and muffled if it <pb n="v10-12 p.255"/> is obstructed,
                            while it becomes rasping if the throat is inflamed, and may be compared
                            to an organ with broken pipes in cases where the throat is subject to
                            spasms. </p>

                            again soon after the obstruction is past, still leave a hollow space in
                            rear of the object struck. An excess of moisture also impedes the voice,
                            while a deficiency weakens it. As regards fatigue, its effect is the
                            same as upon the body: it affects the voice not merely at the moment of
                            speaking, but for some time afterwards. </p>

                            of exercise which they require. For the orator is too much occupied by
                            civil affairs to be able to allot fixed times for taking a walk, and he
                            cannot tune his voice through all the notes of the scale nor spare it
                            exertion, since it is frequently necessary for him to speak in several

                            the singer mellows all sounds, even the highest, by the modulation of
                            his voice, whereas we have often to speak in harsh and agitated tones,
                            must pass wakeful nights, swallow the soot that is produced by the
                            midnight oil and stick to our work though our clothes be dripping with

                            give it exercise suited to the tasks on which it will be employed, never

                            excess of clearness, give an impression of extravagance and are
                            incompatible with the inflexions demanded by delivery and place too

                            tightened, the sound becomes thinner and shriller. Consequently, the
                            deepest notes lack force, and the higher run the risk of cracking the
                            voice. The orator will, therefore, employ the intermediate notes, which
                            must be raised when we speak with energy and lowered when we adopt a
                            more subdued tone. </p>

                        <p> For the first essential of a good delivery is evenness. The voice must
                            not run joltingly, with irregularity of rhythm and sound, mixing long
                            and short syllables, grave accents and acute, tones loud and low,
                            without discrimination, the result being that this universal unevenness
                            produces the impression of <pb n="v10-12 p.267"/> a limping gait. The
                            second essential is variety of tone, and it is in this alone that
                            delivery really consists. </p>

                            evenness and variety are incompatible with one another, since the fault
                            opposed to evenness is unevenness, while the opposite of variety is that

                            refreshes the ear, but, by the very fact that it involves a change of
                            effort, revives the speaker's flagging energies. It is like the relief
                            caused by changes in position, such as are involved by standing,
                            walking, sitting and lying, none of which can be endured for a long time

                            various subjects on which we are speaking and the moods that they
                            demand: otherwise our voice will be at variance with our language. We

                            and voice. By this I do not simply mean that we must avoid saying
                            everything in a loud tone, a fault which amounts to madness, or in a
                            colloquial tone, which creates an impression of lifelessness, or in a

                            choice, but to compulsion. Therefore, in attacking a period of abnormal
                            length, we should collect our breath, but quickly, noiselessly and
                            imperceptibly. On other occasions we shall be able to take breath at the

                            shortly proceed to show to what extent such musical modulations are
                            permissible: but if we are to call it singing, it must be no more than a
                            suggestion of singing, a fact which too many refuse to realise. </p>

                            delivery. Such appropriateness obviously lies in the adaptation of the
                            delivery to the subjects on which we are speaking. This quality is, in
                            the main, supplied by the emotions themselves, and the voice will ring
                            as passion strikes its chords. But there is a difference between true
                            emotion on the one hand, and false and fictitious emotion on the other.
                            The former breaks out naturally, as in the case of grief, anger or
                            indignation, but lacks art, and therefore requires to be formed by
                            methodical training. </p>

                            appropriate feeling in oneself, to form a mental picture of the facts,
                            and to exhibit an emotion that cannot be distinguished from the truth.
                            The voice, which is the intermediary between ourselves and our hearers,
                            will then produce precisely the same emotion in the judge that we have
                            put into it. For it is the index of the mind, and is capable of
                            expressing all its varieties of feeling. </p>

                            sufficiently clear from the fact that there are many things which it can

                            also with a nod from the head: signs take the place of language in the
                            dumb, and the movements of the dance are frequently full of meaning, and
                            appeal to the emotions without any aid from words. The temper of the
                            mind can be inferred from the glance and gait, <pb n="v10-12 p.281"/> and

                            motionless, penetrate into our innermost feelings with such power that

                            reason that Demosthenes used to practise his delivery in front of a

                            reversed, he trusted his eyes to enable him to judge accurately the
                            effect produced. The head, being the chief member of the body, has a
                            corresponding importance in delivery, serving not merely to produce
                            graceful elect, but to illustrate our meaning as well. </p>

                            which indicate things by means of mimicry. For example, you may suggest
                            a sick man by mimicking the gesture of a doctor feeling the pulse, or a
                            harpist by a movement of the hands as though they were plucking the
                            strings. But this is a type of gesture which should be rigorously

                            dignified performers on the stage. I should, therefore, permit him to
                            direct his hand towards his body to indicate that he is speaking of
                            himself, or to point it at some one else to whom he is alluding,

                            even to force the voice through the teeth in phrases such as <quote>What
                                shall I do now?</quote>
                        <quote>What would you do?</quote> To point at
                            something with the thumb turned back is a gesture which is in general

                        <p> Motion is generally divided into six kinds, but circular motion must be
                            regarded as a seventh. The latter alone is faulty when applied to
                            gesture. The remaining motionsâ that is, forward, to right or left and
                            up or downâall have their significance, but the gesture is never
                            directed to what lies behind us, though we do at <pb n="v10-12 p.301"/>

                        <p> The best effect is produced by letting the motion of the hand start from
                            the left and end on the right, but this must be done gently, the hand
                            sinking to rest and avoiding all appearance of giving a blow, although
                            at the end of a sentence it may sometimes be allowed to drop, but must
                            quickly be raised again: or it may occasionally, when we desire to
                            express wonder or dissent, spring back with a rapid motion. In this
                            connexion the earlier instructors in the art of gesture rightly added
                            that the movement of the hand should begin: and end with the thought
                            that is expressed. Otherwise the gesture will anticipate or lag behind
                            the voice, both of which produce an unpleasing effect. </p>

                            desirous that there should be some standard of speed or slowness (a most
                            rational desire), with a view to avoid prolonged inactivity on the part
                            of the hands as well as the opposite fault, into which so many fall, of

                        <p> From this springs a further error, namely, that young men, when writing
                            out their speeches, <pb n="v10-12 p.303"/> devise all their gestures in
                            advance and consider as they compose how the hand is to fall at each
                            particular point. A further unfortunate result is that the movement of
                            the hand, which should end on the right, frequently finishes on the
                            left. </p>

                        <p> It is therefore better, in view of the fact that all speech falls into a
                            number of brief clauses, at the end of which we can take breath, if
                            necessary, to arrange our gesture to suit these sections. For example,
                            the words <hi rend="italic">novum crimes, Gai Caesar,</hi> in a sense
                            form a phrase complete in itself, since they are followed by a
                            conjunction, while the next words, <hi rend="italic">et ante hanc diem
                                non auditum,</hi> are also sufficiently self-contained. To these
                            phrases the motions of the hand must be conformed, before the speech has
                            passed beyond the calmness of tone on which it opens. </p>

                            Some places are best suited by a rapid, and others by a restrained
                            delivery. In the one case we pass rapidly on, fire a volley of arguments
                            and hurry upon our way; in the other, we drive home our points, force
                            them on the hearer and implant them in his mind. But the slower the
                            delivery, the greater its emotional power: thus, Rosins was rapid and
                            ESOPs weighty in his delivery, because the former was a comic and the
                            latter a tragic actor. </p>

                            brought forward in unison with the head, which will incline to the

                                took up less room in such cases, and the orator's peregrinations
                                would be but small. See Â§ 134 note. </note> On the other hand, we

                            the spear. The only condition that justifies our walking about while

                            their friends or looking back at their clerks, as if telling them to

                            style of the shoes, or the arrangement of the hair, is just as
                            reprehensible as excessive carelessness. There are also details of dress
                            which are altered to some extent by successive changes in fashion. The
                            ancients, for example, wore no folds, and their successors wore them
                            very short. </p>

                        <p> Consequently it follows that in view of the fact that their arms were,
                            like those of the Greeks, covered by the garment, they must have
                            employed a different form of gesture in the exordium from that which is
                            now in use. However, I am speaking of our own day. The speaker who has
                            not the right to wear the broad stripe, <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Worn by senators.</note> will wear his girdle in
                            such a way that the front edges of the tunic fall a little below his
                            knees, while the edges in rear reach to the middle of his hams. For only
                            women draw them lower and only centurions higher. </p>

                        <p> If we wear the purple stripe, it requires but little care to see that it
                            fills becomingly; negligence in this respect sometimes excites
                            criticism. Among those who wear the broad stripe, it is the fashion to
                            let it hang somewhat lower than in garments that are retained by the
                            girdle. The toga itself should, in my opinion, be round, and cut to fit,
                            otherwise there are a number of ways in which it may be unshapely. Its
                            front edge should by preference reach to the middle of the shin, while
                            tie back should be higher in proposition as the girdle is higher <pb n="v10-12 p.321"/> behind than in front. </p>

                            other fold which passes obliquely like a belt under the right shoulder
                            and over the left, should neither be too tight nor too loose. The
                            portion of the toga which is last to be arranged should fall rather low,
                            since it will sit better thus and be kept in its place. A portion of the
                            tunic also should be drawn back in order that it may not fall over the
                            arm when we are pleading, and the fold should be thrown over the
                            shoulder, while it will not be unbecoming if the edge be turned back.

                            varicose veins, despite the fact that this fashion is to be seen in the

                            these, there is, at any rate, no reason why we should not place the

                            be varied to suit the characteristics of different orators and different
                            judges, so it is with delivery. The same characteristics of voice,

                            emperor, the senate, the people, and magistrates, or in private and

                            pleading. Anyone who will reflect upon the matter will realise the
                            nature of the differences involved, as he will also be able to realise

                            some of the qualities already mentioned. If it aims at soothing them, it
                            should How softly; if it is to rouse them to pity, the voice must be
                            delicately modulated to a melancholy sweetness, which is at once most
                            natural and specially adapted to touch the heart. For it may be noted
                            that even orphans and widows have a certain musical quality in the
                            lamentations which they utter at funerals. </p>

                        <p> There are some persons in whom positive excellences have no charm, while
                            there are others whose very faults give pleasure. We have seen the
                            greatest of comic actors, Demetrius and Stratocles, win their success by
                            entirely different merits. But that is the less surprising owing to the
                            fact that the one was at his best in the rÃ´les of gods, young men, good
                            fathers and slaves, matrons and respectable old women, while the other

                            parasites, pimps and all the more lively characters of comedy. For their
                            natural gifts differed. For Demetrius' voice, like his other qualities,
                            had greater charm, while that of Stratocles was the more powerful. </p>

                            action. Demetrius showed unique gifts in the movements of his hands, in
                            his power to charm his audience by the longdrawn sweetness of his
                            exclamations, the skill with which he would make his dress seem to puff
                            out with wind as he walked, and the expressive movements of the right
                            side which he sometimes introduced with effect, in all of which things

                            even in the way in which he sank his neck into his shoulders. If either

                            I have set myself to perform. Indeed had I fully realised the
                            difficulties when I first designed this work, I should have considered
                            betimes whether my strength was sufficient to support the load that now
                            weighs upon me so heavily. But to begin with, I felt how shameful it
                            would be to fail to perform what I had promised, and later, despite the
                            fact that my labour became more and more arduous at almost every stage,
                            the fear of stultifying what I had already written sustained my courage
                            through every difficulty. </p>

                            rather than despair. But the fact that I began with comparatively
                            trivial details deceived me. Subsequently I was lured still further on
                            my voyage by the temptations of the favouring breeze that filled my
                            sails; but the rules which I was then concerned to give were still of a
                            familiar kind and had been already treated by most writers of rhetorical
                            textbooks: thus far I seemed to myself to be still in sight of shore and
                            I had the company of many who had ventured to entrust themselves to the

                            sail and to row a slower stroke, and is content to speak merely of the
                            kind of speech to be employed by the perfect orator. But my temerity is

                            far, far on, as my theme may demand. Still an honourable ambition is
                            always deserving of approval, and it is all the less hazardous to dare
                            greatly, when forgiveness is assured us if we fail. </p>

                            distinguishes us from other living things, if she devised the power of

                            be an orator unless he is a good man. For it is impossible to regard
                            those men as gifted with intelligence who on being offered the choice
                            between the two paths of virtue and of vice choose the latter, nor can
                            we allow them prudence, when by the unforeseen issue of their own
                            actions they render themselves liable not merely to the heaviest
                            penalties of the laws, but to the inevitable torment of an evil

                            will most assuredly never become an orator. To this must be added the
                            fact that the mind will not find leisure even for the study of the
                            noblest of tasks, unless it first be free from vice. The reasons for
                            this are, first, that vileness and virtue cannot jointly inhabit in the
                            selfsame heart and that it is as impossible for one and the same mind to
                            harbour good <pb n="v10-12 p.359"/> and evil thoughts as it is for one man

                            among which must be included even those preoccupations which are free

                            attainment of either, why should not someone succeed in attaining both
                            together? And why should not each of us hope to be that happy man? </p>

                            show that, in the event of his being compelled to take such action, it
                            will not invalidate our definition of an orator as a <quote>good man,

                            Consequently, the same methods of defence have to be employed that would
                            be used if he were guilty. Further, there are countless elements which

                            defend these virtues, are using the weapons of rhetoric, not their own.

                            as to which school of philosophy is like to prove of most service to
                            oratory, although there are only a few that can be said to contend for

                            with as easy and favourable a case as may be (just as the cubs of wild
                            beasts are brought up to start with on softer forms of prey), and should
                            not proceed straight from this commencement to plead case after case
                            without a break, or cause his talents to set and harden while they still
                            require nourishment; on the contrary, as soon as he has come to realise
                            the nature of the conflicts in which he will have to engage and the
                            object to which his studies should be directed, he should take an
                            interval of rest and refreshment. Thus, </p>

                            his task. This was the method employed by Cicero: for when he had
                            already won a distinguished position at the bar of his day, he took ship
                            to Asia and there studied under a number of professors of philosophy and
                            rhetoric, but above all under Apollonius Molon, whose lectures he had
                            attended at Rome and to whom he now at Rhodes entrusted the refashioning
                            and recasting of his style. It is only when theory and practice are
                            brought into a perfect harmony that the orator reaps the reward of all
                            his study. </p>

                            the state or towards individuals and refuse to call any man to render an

                            them; and to regard it as a sin to demand the punishment of crime is
                            almost equivalent to the sanctioning of crime, while it is certainly
                            contrary to the interest of the good to give the wicked free leave to

                            real designs. But the truth is that the eloquence of those days was
                            capable of concealment, for it had not yet attained that splendour of
                            diction which makes it impossible to hide its light under a bushel.
                            Therefore artifice and stratagem should be masked, since detection in
                            such cases spells failure. Thus far, and thus only, may eloquence hope

                            confronted by elements which must either strike the attention or be
                            condemned to nonexistence. But the very fact that they strike the
                            attention is a reason why they should not flaunt themselves obtrusively.
                            And, if we have to make the choice, I should prefer that it should be

                            Nevertheless, the true orator will achieve the distinction of seeming to
                            speak with all the excellence that an excellent case deserves. One thing

                            Antiphilus for facility, Theon of Samos for his depiction of imaginary

                            especial pride. Euphranor, on the other hand, was admired on the ground
                            that, while he ranked with the most eminent masters of other arts, he at
                            the same time achieved marvellous skill in the arts of sculpture and

                        <p> The distinction between the Attic and the Asiatic schools takes us back
                            to antiquity. The former were regarded as concise and healthy, the
                            latter as empty and inflated: the former were remarkable for the absence
                            of all superfluity, while the latter were deficient alike in taste and
                            restraint. The reason for this division, according to some authorities,
                            among them Santra, is to be found in the fact that, as Greek gradually
                            extended its range into the neighbouring cities of Asia, there arose a
                            class of men who desired to distinguish themselves as orators before
                            they had acquired sufficient command of the language, and who
                            consequently began to express by periphrases what could have been
                            expressed directly, until finally this practice became an ingrained

                            attributable to the character both of the orators and the audiences whom
                            they addressed: the Athenians, with their polish and refinement, refused
                            to tolerate emptiness and redundance, while the Asiatics, being
                            naturally given to bombast and ostentation, were puffed up with a
                            passion for a more vainglorious style of eloquence. </p>

                            between the two and to be a blend of both, since the orators of this
                            school are neither so concise as the Attic nor redundant like the
                            Asiatic school, but appear to derive their style in part from their
                            national characteristics, in part from those of their founder. </p>

                            the fine Attic flavour was marred by the admixture of foreign
                            ingredients. Consequently certain of the orators of this school are
                            regarded as somewhat slow and lacking in energy, though not devoid of a
                            certain weight, and as resembling placid pools rather than the limpid

                            to be by far the best. But although all Attic writers have something in
                            comion, namely a keen and exact judgement, their talents manitest

                            eloquence, and keep their hands modestly within the folds of their
                            cloaks. For what author is there who answers to this conception? I am
                            prepared to grant that there is Lysias, since he is the favourite model

                            and for stirring the emotions force. Consequently it is mainly in the
                            plain style that we shall state our facts and advance our proofs, though
                            it should be borne in mind that this style will often be sufficiently

                        <p> But the chief fault lies with our teachers, in that they love to keep

                            desire to draw their miserable fees for as long as possible, partly out
                            of ostentation, to enhance the difficulty of acquiring the knowledge
                            which they promise to impart, and to some extent owing to their
                            ignorance or carelessness in teaching. The next most serious fault lies
                            in ourselves, who think it better to linger over what we have learned

                            prevalent (for I will say nothing of those who spend almost their whole
                            lives), in declaiming in the schools and devoting so much labour to the
                            treatment of fictitious themes, when it would be possible with but
                            slight expenditure of time to form some idea of what the true conflicts
                            are in which the orator must engage, and of the laws of speaking which

                        <p> In saying this, I do not for a moment mean to suggest that we should
                            ever omit to exercise ourselves in speaking. I merely urge that we
                            should not grow old over one special form of exercise. We have been in a
                            position to acquire varied knowledge, to familiarise ourselves with the
                            principles that should guide our life, and to try our strength in the
                            courts, while we were still attending the schools. The theory of
                            speaking is of such a nature that it does not demand many years for its
                            acquisition. For any one of the various branches of knowledge which I
                            have mentioned will, as a rule, be found to be comprised in a few
                            volumes, a fact which shows that instruction does not require an
                            indefinite amount of time to be devoted to it. The rest depends entirely
                            on practice, which at once develops our powers and maintains them, once
