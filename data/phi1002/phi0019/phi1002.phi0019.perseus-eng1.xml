                    In my last book I spoke of
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes.</hi>
                    I now come
to
                    <hi rend="italic">figures,</hi>
                    called
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">sxh/mata</foreign>
                    in Greek, a topic which is
naturally and closely connected with the preceding.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    For many authors have considered
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    identical
with
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes,</hi>
                    because whether it be that the latter
derive their name from having a certain form or from
the fact that they effect alterations in language (a
view which has also led to their being styled
                    <hi rend="italic">motions</hi>
                    ),
it must be admitted that both these features are
found in
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    as well. Their employment is also
the same. For they add force and charm to our
matter. There are some again who call
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes figures,</hi>
                    Artorius Proculus among them.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Further the resemblance between the two is so close that it is not easy
to distinguish between them. For although certain
kinds differ, while retaining a general resemblance
(since both involve a departure from the simple and
straightforward method of expression coupled with
a certain rhetorical excellence), on the other hand
some are distinguished by the narrowest possible
dividing line: for example, while
                    <hi rend="italic">irony</hi>
                    belongs to
                    <hi rend="italic">figures of thought</hi>
                    just as much as to
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes,</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See IX. ii. 44.</note>
                    <hi rend="italic"> periphrasis, hyperbaton</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italic">onomatopoea</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        VIII. vi. 59
                        <hi rend="italic">sqq.,</hi>
                        62, 31 respectively.
                    </note>
                    have been ranked by
distinguished authors as
                    <hi rend="italic">figures of speech</hi>
                    rather than
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    It is therefore all the more necessary to point out
the distinction between the two. The name of
                    <hi rend="italic">trope</hi>
                    <pb xml:id="p.351"/>
                    is applied to the transference of expressions from
their natural and principal signification to another,
with a view to the embellishment of style or, as the
majority of grammarians define it, the transference
of words and phrases from the place which is strictly
theirs to another to which they do not properly
belong. A
                    <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi>
                    on the other hand, as is clear from
the name itself, is the term employed when we give
our language a conformation other than the obvious
and ordinary.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    Therefore the substitution of one
word for another is placed among
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes,</hi>
                    as for
example in the case of
                    <hi rend="italic">metaphor, metonymy, antonomasia, metalepsis, synecdochè, catachresis, allegory</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See VIII. vi.</note>
                    and,
as a rule,
                    <hi rend="italic">hyperbole,</hi>
                    which may, of course, be concerned either with words or things.
                    <hi rend="italic">Onomatopoea</hi>
                    is
the creation of a word and therefore involves substitution for the words which we should use but
for such creation.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Again although
                    <hi rend="italic">periphrasis</hi>
                    often
includes the actual word whose place it supplies, it
still uses a number of words in place of one. The
                    <hi rend="italic">epithet</hi>
                    as a rule involves an element of
                    <hi rend="italic">antonomasia</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">VIII. vi. 29 and 46.</note>
                    and consequently becomes a
                    <hi rend="italic">trope</hi>
                    on account of this
affinity.
                    <hi rend="italic">Hyperbaton</hi>
                    is a change of order and for
this reason many exclude it from
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes.</hi>
                    None the
less it transfers a word or part of a word from its
own place to another.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    None of these can be called
                    <hi rend="italic">figures.</hi>
                    For a
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    does not necessarily involve
any alteration either of the order or the strict sense
of words. As regards
                    <hi rend="italic">irony,</hi>
                    I shall show elsewhere
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">IX. ii. 44.</note>
                    how in some of its forms it is a
                    <hi rend="italic">trope,</hi>
                    in others a
                    <hi rend="italic">figure.</hi>
                    For I admit that the name is common to
both and am aware of the complicated and minute
discussions to which it has given rise. They, however, have no bearing on my present task. For it
                    <pb xml:id="p.353"/>
                    makes no difference by which name either is called, so
long as its stylistic value is apparent, since the meaning of things is not altered by a change of name.
For just as men remain the same,
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    even though they
adopt a new name, so these artifices will produce
exactly the same effect, whether they are styled
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes</hi>
                    or
                    <hi rend="italic">figures,</hi>
                    since their values lie not in their
names, but in their effect. Similarly it makes no
difference whether we call a
                    <hi rend="italic">basis</hi>
                    conjectural or
negative, or concerned with fact or substance,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See III. vi. 15, 39.</note>
                    provided always that we know that the subject of
enquiry is the same.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    It is best therefore in dealing
with these topics to adopt the generally accepted
terms and to understand the actual thing, by whatever name it is called. But we must note the fact
that
                    <hi rend="italic">trope</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    are often combined in the
expression of the same thought, since figures are
introduced just as much by the metaphorical as by
the literal use of words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    There is, however, a considerable difference of
opinion among authors as to the meaning of the
name,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">i.e. figure.</note>
                    the number of
                    <hi rend="italic">genera</hi>
                    and the nature and
number of the
                    <hi rend="italic">species</hi>
                    into which figures may be
divided. The first point for consideration is, therefore, what is meant by a
                    <hi rend="italic">figure.</hi>
                    For the term is
used in two senses. In the first it is applied to any
form in which thought is expressed, just as it is to
bodies which, whatever their composition, must have
some shape.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    In the second and special sense, in
which it is called a
                    <hi rend="italic">schema,</hi>
                    it means a rational change
in meaning or language from the ordinary and simple
form, that is to say, a change analogous to that
involved by sitting, lying down on something or
looking back. Consequently when a student tends
                    <pb xml:id="p.355"/>
                    to continuous or at any rate excessive use of the
same cases, tenses, rhythms or even feet, we are in
the habit of instructing him to vary his
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    with
a view to the avoidance of monotony.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    In so doing
we speak as if every kind of language possessed a
                    <hi rend="italic">figure:</hi>
                    for example
                    <hi rend="italic">cursitare</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italic">lectitare</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Frequentative forms of
                        <hi rend="italic">curro</hi>
                        (run) and
                        <hi rend="italic">lego</hi>
                        (read).

                    are said
to have the same figure, that is to say, they are
identical in formation. Therefore in the first and
common sense of the word everything is expressed
by
                    <hi rend="italic">figures.</hi>
                    If we are content with this view, there
is good reason for the opinion expressed by Apollodorus (if we may trust the statement of Caecilius on
this point) to the effect that he found the rules laid
down in this connexion quite incomprehensible.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    If,
on the other hand, the name is to be applied to
certain attitudes, or I might say gestures of language,
we must interpret
                    <hi rend="italic">schema</hi>
                    in the sense of that which
is poetically or rhetorically altered from the simple
and obvious method of expression. It will then be
true to distinguish between the style which is devoid
of figures (or
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)sxhma/tistos</foreign>
                    ) and that which is adorned
with figures (or
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)sxhmatisme/nh,</foreign>
                    ).
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    But Zoilus narrowed
down the definition, since he restricted the term
                    <hi rend="italic">schema</hi>
                    to cases when the speaker pretends to say
something other than that which he actually does
say. 1 know that this view meets with common
acceptance: it is, in fact, for this reason that we speak
                    <hi rend="italic">of figured</hi>
                    controversial themes, of which I shall
shortly speak.

                    Some writers have held that there is only one
kind of
                    <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi>
                    although they differ as regards the
reasons which lead them to adopt this view. For
                    <pb xml:id="p.357"/>
                    some of them, on the ground that a change of words
causes a corresponding change in the sense, assert
that all
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    are concerned with words, while others
hold that
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    are concerned solely with the sense,
on the ground that words are adapted to things.
Both these views are obviously quibbling.

                    For the

the sense remains unaltered though the words are
changed, while a

                    may include several

                    For the former lies in the conception, the latter in the expression of our thought.
The two are frequently combined, however, as in
the following passage:

                    It is, however, to the best of my knowledge,
generally agreed by the majority of authors that
there are two classes of
                    <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi>
                    namely
                    <hi rend="italic">figures of thought,</hi>
                    that is of the mind, feeling or conceptions,

                    that is of words, diction, expression, language or

thought? We may therefore conclude that, like
language itself, figures are necessarily concerned with
thought and with words.

                    As, however, in the natural course of things we
conceive ideas before we express them, I must take
                    <hi rend="italic">figures of thought</hi>
                    first. Their utility is at once great
and manifold, and is revealed with the utmost clearness in every product of oratory. For although it
may seem that proof is infinitesimally affected by
                    <hi rend="italic">the figures</hi>
                    employed, none the less those same
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    lend credibility to our arguments and steal their
way secretly into the minds of the judges.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    For just
as in sword-play it is easy to see, parry, and ward off'
direct blows and simple and straightforward thrusts,
while side-strokes and feints are less easy to observe
and the task of the skilful swordsman is to give the
impression that his design is quite other than it
actually is, even so the oratory in which there is
no guile fights by sheer weight and impetus alone;
on the other hand, the fighter who feints and varies
his assault is able to attack flank or back as he will,
to lure his opponent's weapons from their guard and
to outwit him by a slight inclination of the body.
Further,
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    there is no more effective method of exciting
the emotions than an apt use of figures. For if the
expression of brow, eyes and hands has a powerful
effect in stirring the passions, how much more
effective must be the aspect of our style itself when
composed to produce the result at which we aim?
But, above all,
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    serve to commend what we
say to those that hear us, whether we seek to win
approval for our character as pleaders, or to win
favour for the cause which we plead, to relieve
monotony by variation of our language, or to indicate
our meaning in the safest or most seemly way.

                    But before I proceed to demonstrate what
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    best suit the different circumstances, I must
                    <pb xml:id="p.361"/>
                    point out that their number is far from being as
great as some authorities make out. For I am not
in the least disturbed by the various names which
the Greeks more especially are so fond of inventing.
First of all, then,
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    I must repudiate the views of those
who hold that there are as many types of
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    as there are kinds of emotion, on the ground, not
that emotions are not qualities of the mind, but that
a figure, in its strict, not its general sense, is not
simply the expression of anything you choose to
select. Consequently the expression in words of
anger, grief, pity, fear, confidence or contempt is
not a
                    <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi>
                    any more than persuasion, threats,
entreaty or excuse.

                    But superficial observers are
deceived by the fact that they find
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    in all
passages dealing with such themes, and select
examples of them from speeches; whereas in reality
there is no department of oratory which does not
admit such
                    <hi rend="italic">figures.</hi>
                    But it is one thing to admit
                    <hi rend="italic">i&gt;figure</hi>
                    and another to be a
                    <hi rend="italic">figure;</hi>
                    I am not going
to be frightened out of repeating the term with some
frequency in my attempt to make the facts clear.
My opponents will, I know,
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    direct my attention to
special figures employed in expressing anger, in
entreating for mercy, or appealing to pity, but it
does not follow that expressions of anger, appeals
to pity or entreaties for mercy are in themselves
                    <hi rend="italic">figures.</hi>
                    Cicero, it is true, includes all ornaments of
oratory under this head, and in so doing adopts, as
it seems to me, a middle course. For he does not
hold that all forms of expression are to be regarded
as
                    <hi rend="italic">figures,</hi>
                    nor, on the other hand, would he restrict
the term merely to those expressions whose form
varies from ordinary use. But he regards as
                    <pb xml:id="p.363"/>
                    figurative all those expressions which are especially
striking and most effective in stirring the emotions
of the audience. He sets forth this view in two of
his works, and that my readers may have the
opportunity of realising the judgment of so high

be produced by dwelling on a single point, and by
setting forth our facts in such a striking manner
that they seem to be placed before the eyes as
vividly as if they were taking place in our actual
presence. This is especially effective in stating a
case or for the purpose of illuminating and amplifying the facts in course of statement, with a view to
making our audience regard the point which we
amplify as being as important as speech can make
it.

we may often give a rapid summary, suggest more
than is actually said, may express ourselves tersely
in short, clean-cut sentences and disparage, or, what
is much the same, mock our opponent in a manner
not inconsistent with the precepts given us by Caesar.

or attenuating the force of some point, we may
exaggerate and overstate the truth: we may ask
questions, or, what is much the same, enquire of
others and set forth our own opinion. There is also
available the device of dissimulation, when we say
one thing and mean another, the most effective of
all means of stealing into the minds of men and a

against ourselves. We may defend ourselves by
anticipation to secure the success of some point
which we propose to make or may transfer the blame
for some action to another. We may confer with
our audience, admitting them as it were into our
deliberations, may describe the life and character
of persons either with or without mention of their
names, a device which is one of the greatest embellishments of oratory and specially adapted to
conciliate the feelings, as also frequently to excite
them.

personages we may bring into play the most forcible
form of exaggeration. We may describe the results
likely to follow some action, introduce topics to lead
our hearers astray, move them to mirth or anticipate
the arguments of our opponent. Comparisons and
examples may be introduced, both of them most
effective methods; we may divide, interrupt, contrast,
suppress, commend.

our case, entreaty, supplication, slight deviations
from our proposed course (which must be distinguished from the longer digressions mentioned
above), exculpation, conciliation, personal attacks,

may be employed for the adornment of our speech.
As regards diction, this may either be employed like
weapons for menace and attack, or handled merely
for the purpose of display. For example, sometimes
the repetition of words will produce an impression
of force, at other times of grace. Again, slight
changes and alterations may be made in words,
the same word may be repeated sometimes at the
beginning of a sentence and sometimes at the end,

                        And those other embellishments which are derived from the arrangement of
words contribute greatly to the adornment of our style.
They may be compared to what we term the decorations of the forum or a richly-ornamented stage, since
they not only adorn, but stand out conspicuously in
the midst of other ornaments.

in asyndeton without connecting particles. Or we

for such omission, or correct ourselves with apparent
censure of our carelessness, may utter exclamations of

                        The ornaments of
thought are, however, more important. They are so
frequently employed by Demosthenes that some
critics have held that it is in them that the chief
beauty of his style resides. And in truth there is
hardly a topic in his speeches which is not distinguished by some artificial treatment of the thought,
and it must be admitted that speaking involves the
embellishment of all, or at any rate most of our
thoughts with some form of ornament.
                        <milestone n="41" unit="section"/>
                        As you,
Brutus, have such an admirable knowledge of all
these methods, it would be waste of time for me to
cite all their names or to give illustrations. I shall
therefore content myself merely with indicating this
topic. Our ideal orator then will speak in such a
manner that he will cast the same thought into a
number of different forms, will dwell on one point
and linger over the same idea.
                        <milestone n="42" unit="section"/>
                        he will often attenuate some one point or deride his opponent, will
diverge from his theme and give a bias to his thought,
will set forth what he intends to say, after completing his argument will give a brief summary, will

                        recall himself to the point which he has left, repeat
what he has said, complete his proof by a formal
conclusion, embarrass his opponent by asking questions or answer himself in reply to imaginary
questions;
                        <milestone n="43" unit="section"/>
                        will desire his words to be taken in a
different sense from their literal meaning, will
hesitate what argument or form of statement to
prefer, will classify and divide, will deliberately
omit and ignore some point, and defend himself
by anticipation; will transfer the blame of some
charge brought against him to his opponent, will
often take his audience, and sometimes even his
opponent into consultation,
                        <milestone n="44" unit="section"/>
                        will describe the character
and talk of particular persons, will put words into
the mouths of inanimate objects, divert the minds of
the audience from the point at issue, often move
them to merriment or laughter, anticipate objections,
introduce comparisons, cite precedents, assign and
distribute different sentiments to different persons,
silence interrupters, assert that there are certain
things of which he prefers not to speak, warn his
audience to be on their guard against certain things,
or venture on a certain licence of speech. Again, he
will wax angry, sometimes indulge in rebuke, entreaty or supplication, will clear away unfavourable
impressions, swerve a little from his point, utter
wishes or execrations, or address his audience in
terms of familiar intimacy.
                        <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>
                        There are also other
virtues at which he should aim, such as brevity, if his
theme demands it, while he will often set forth topics
in such vivid language as almost to present them to
the very eyes of his audience, or will exaggerate his
subject beyond the bounds of possibility. His meaning will frequently be deeper than his words seem to

                        indicate, his tone will often be cheerful, and he will
often mimic life and character. In fact, as regards
this department of oratory, of which I have given
you the substance, lie must display eloquence in all
its grandest forms.

                    The student who desires to give a wider consideration to figures of thought and speech will,
therefore, have a guide to follow, and 1 would not
venture to assert that he could have a better. But
I would ask him to read these passages of Cicero with
reference to my own views on this subject. For I
intend to speak only of those figures of thought
which depart from the direct method of statement,
and I note that a similar procedure has been adopted
by a number of learned scholars.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    On the other hand,
all those embellishments which differ in character
from these are none the less virtues whose importance is such that without them all oratory will be
little less than unintelligible. For how can the judge
be adequately instructed unless lucidity characterise
our performance of the following tasks: explanation,
proposition, promise of proofs, definition, distinction,
exposition of our own opinion, logical conclusion, defence by anticipation, introduction of comparisons or
precedents, disposition and distribution, interruption,
repression of those who interrupt us, antithesis, exculpation and personal attack?
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Again, what would
eloquence do if deprived of the artifices of amplification and its opposite? of which the first requires the
gift of signifying more than we say, that is
                    <hi rend="italic">emphasis,</hi>
                    together with exaggeration and overstatement of the
truth, while the latter requires the power to diminish
and palliate. What scope is there for the stronger
emotions if the orator is not allowed to give free rein
                    <pb xml:id="p.377"/>
                    to his speech, to flame out in anger, to reproach, to
wish or execrate? Or for the milder emotions without the assistance of commendation, conciliation and
humour?
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    What pleasure can an orator hope to produce, or what impression even of the most moderate
learning, unless he knows how to fix one point in the
minds of the audience by repetition, and another by
dwelling on it, how to digress from and return to his
theme, to divert the blame from himself and transfer
it to another, or to decide what points to omit and
what to ignore as negligible? It is qualities such as
these that give life and vigour to oratory; without
them it lies torpid like a body lacking the breath to
stir its limbs.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    But more than the mere possession of
these qualities is required; they must be deployed,
each in their proper place and with such variety that
every sound may bewitch the hearer with all the
charm of music. But these qualities are as a rule
open and direct, manifesting themselves without
disguise. They do, however, as I have said, admit
of
                    <hi rend="italic">figures,</hi>
                    as the instances to which I shall proceed

                    <hi rend="italic">enquire?</hi>
                    For both terms are used indifferently, although the
one seems to imply a desire for knowledge, and the
other a desire to prove something. But whichever
term we use, the thing which they represent admits
a variety of figures. We will begin with those which
serve to increase the force and cogency of proof to
which I assign the first place.

                    A figure is also involved
in a reply, when one question is asked and another
is answered, because it suits the respondent's purpose
better to do so, or because it aggravates the charge
brought against the accused. For example, a witness
for the prosecution was asked whether he had been
cudgelled by the plaintiff, and replied,
                    <quote>And what is more, I had done him no harm.</quote>
                    Or the purpose

                    If it were meant seriously,
it would be tantamount to a confession. Further,
there is the practice of putting the question and
answering it oneself, which may have quite a pleasing
effect. Take as an example the following passage
from the

                    A different
method is to ask a question and not to wait for a
reply, but to subjoin the reply at once yourself.
For example,

                    <pb xml:id="p.385"/>
                    has several different species. One of these is the
defence by anticipation, such as Cicero employs
against Quintus Caecilius,

                    where he points out that
though previously he himself has always appeared
for the defence, he is now undertaking a prosecution.
Another is a form of
                    <hi rend="italic">confession,</hi>
                    such as he introduces
in his defence of Rabirius Postumus,

                    where he
admits that he himself regards his client as worthy
of censure for lending money to the king. Another
takes the form of

is

to our statements, when, for example, we pretend
to be at a loss, where to begin or end, or to decide
what especially requires to be said or not to be said
at all. All speeches are full of such instances, but
for the present one will be enough.

the clemency of the victor.

                    By this means we display the
inner thoughts of our adversaries as though they were
talking with themselves (but we shall only carry conviction if we represent them as uttering what they
may reasonably be supposed to have had in their
minds); or without sacrifice of credibility we may
introduce conversations between ourselves and others,
or of others among themselves, and put words of
advice, reproach, complaint, praise or pity into the
mouths of appropriate persons.

                    For my own part, I have
included both under the same generally accepted
term, since we cannot imagine a speech without we
also imagine a person to utter it. But when we lend
a voice to things to which nature has denied it, we
may soften down the

                    A bolder
figure of the same kind may be illustrated by the
following:

                        Your country, Catiline, pleads with you

                    It is also convenient at times to pretend that we have before our
eyes the images of things, persons or utterances, or
to marvel that the same is not the case with our
adversaries or the judges; it is with this design that
we use phrases such as
                    <quote>It seems to me,</quote>
                    or
                    <quote>Does it not seem to you?</quote>
                    But such devices make a great
demand on our powers of eloquence. For with things
which are false and incredible by nature there are but
two alternatives: either they will move our hearers
with exceptional force because they are beyond the
truth, or they will be regarded as empty nothings
because they are not the truth.

                    There are a number of different figures by which
this effect may be produced. We may, for instance,
pretend that we expected something different or
feared some greater disaster, or that the judges in
their ignorance of the facts may regard some point
as of more importance than it really is: an example
of this latter device is to be found in the exordium
to Cicero's defence of Caelius.

                    Nor is it only past or present actions
which we may imagine: we may equally well present
a picture of what is likely to happen or might have
happened. This is done with extraordinary skill by
Cicero in his defence of Milo,

                    Modern authors, however, more especially
the declaimers, are bolder, indeed they show the
utmost animation in giving rein to their imagination;
witness the following passages from Seneca's treatment of the controversial theme in which a father,
guided by one of his sons, finds another son in the
act of adultery with his stepmother and kills both
culprits.

                    does not cover the whole range of this figure, I shall
follow my general rule and rest content with the
Greek term.
                    <hi rend="italic">Irony</hi>
                    involving a
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    does not differ
from the
                    <hi rend="italic">irony</hi>
                    which is a
                    <hi rend="italic">trope,</hi>
                    as far as its
                    <hi rend="italic">genus</hi>
                    is
concerned, since in both cases we understand something which is the opposite of what is actually said;
on the other hand, a careful consideration of the
                    <hi rend="italic">species</hi>
                    of
                    <hi rend="italic">irony</hi>
                    will soon reveal the fact that they
differ.
                    <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>
                    In the first place, the
                    <hi rend="italic">trope</hi>
                    is franker in its
meaning, and, despite the fact that it implies something other than it says, makes no pretence about it.
For the context as a rule is perfectly clear, as, for
example, in the following passage from the Catilinarian orations.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">I. viii. 19.</note>
                    <quote>Rejected by him, you migrated to your boon-companion, that excellent gentleman Metellus.</quote>
                    In this case the irony lies in two words,
and is therefore a specially concise form of
                    <hi rend="italic">trope.</hi>
                    <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>
                    But in the
                    <hi rend="italic">figurative</hi>
                    form of irony the speaker disguises his entire meaning, the disguise being apparent
rather than confessed. For in the
                    <hi rend="italic">trope</hi>
                    the conflict
is purely verbal, while in the
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    the meaning, and
sometimes the whole aspect of our case, conflicts with
the language and the tone of voice adopted; nay, a
man's whole life may be coloured with
                    <hi rend="italic">irony,</hi>
                    as was
the case with Socrates, who was called an
                    <hi rend="italic">ironist</hi>
                    because he assumed the role of an ignorant man lost
in wonder at the wisdom of others. Thus, as continued
                    <hi rend="italic">metaphor</hi>
                    develops into
                    <hi rend="italic">allegory,</hi>
                    so a sustained
series of
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes</hi>
                    develops into this

                    There are,
however, certain kinds of

                    which have no
connexion with
                    <hi rend="italic">tropes.</hi>
                    In the first place, there is the
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    which derives its name from negation and is

                    when we assume the tone of command or concession,

                    At times we may exaggerate charges against
ourselves which we can easily refute or deny; this
device is too common to require any illustration. At
other times we may by this same method make the
charges brought against us seem incredible just
because of their gravity: thus Cicero in his defence
of Roscius,

                    by the sheer force of his eloquence,

that it requires no demonstration.

                    act or statement, though in such cases the speaker
more frequently does so to assert his point than for

                    There are other devices also which
are agreeable in themselves and serve not a little
to commend our case both by the introduction of
variety and by their intrinsic naturalness, since by

                    This device
may serve for other purposes as well. For there
are means of this kind whereby we may achieve
an end quite other than that at which we appear
to be aiming, as, for example, Cicero does in the
passage just quoted. For while he taunts Verres
with a morbid passion for acquiring statues and
pictures, he succeeds in creating the impression
that he personally has no interest in such subjects.
So, too, when Demosthenes

could bring no shame. Athens would have been unworthy
of the heroes of old had she not fought for freedom.

                    We may further lend charm to our
speech by deferring the discussion of some points
after just mentioning them, thus depositing them
in the safe keeping of the judge's memory and afterwards reclaiming our deposit; or we may employ
some figure to enable us to repeat certain points
(for repetition is not in itself a figure) or may make
especial mention of certain things and vary the
aspect of our pleading. For eloquence delights
in variety, and just as the eye is more strongly
attracted by the sight of a number of different
things, so oratory supplies a continuous series of
novelties to rivet the attention of the mind.

of the field. A different kind of emphasis is found
in Ovid, where Zmyrna confesses to her nurse her
passion for her father in the following words:

                    Similar, if not identical with this figure is another,
which is much in vogue at the present time. For
I must now proceed to the discussion of a class of
figure which is of the commonest occurrence and
on which I think I shall be expected to make
some comment. It is one whereby we excite some
suspicion to indicate that our meaning is other than
our words would seem to imply; but our meaning
is not in this case contrary to that which we express,
as is the case in
                    <hi rend="italic">ironq,</hi>
                    but rather a hidden meaning
which is left to the hearer to discover. As I have
already pointed out,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">IX. i. 14.</note>
                    modern rhetoricians practically
restrict the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    to this device, from the
use of which
                    <hi rend="italic">figured</hi>
                    controversial themes derive
their name.
                    <milestone n="66" unit="section"/>
                    This class of figure may be employed under three conditions: first, if it is unsafe
to speak openly; secondly, if it is unseemly to speak
openly; and thirdly, when it is employed solely
with a view to the elegance of what we say, and
gives greater pleasure by reason of the novelty and
variety thus introduced than if our meaning had
been expressed in straightforward language.

                    The first of the three is of common occurrence in
the schools, where we imagine conditions laid down
by tyrants on abdication and decrees passed by the
senate after a civil war, and it is a capital offence
to accuse a person with what is past, what is not
                    <pb xml:id="p.417"/>
                    expedient in the courts being actually prohibited
in the schools. But the conditions governing the
employment of figures differ in the two cases. For
we may speak against the tyrants in question as
openly as we please without loss of effect, provided always that what we say is susceptible of a
different interpretation, since it is only danger to
ourselves, and not offence to them, that we have to
avoid.
                    <milestone n="68" unit="section"/>
                    And if the danger can be avoided by any
ambiguity of expression, tile speaker's cunning will
meet with universal approbation. On the other
hand, the actual business of the courts has never
yet involved such necessity for silence, though at
times they require something not unlike it, which
is much more embarrassing for the speaker, as, for
example, when he is hampered by the existence of
powerful personages, whom he must censure if
he is to prove his case.
                    <milestone n="69" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently he must
proceed with greater wariness and circumspection;
since the actual manner in which offence is given
is a matter of indifference, and if a figure is perfectly
obvious, it ceases to be a figure. Therefore such
devices are absolutely repudiated by some authorities, whether the meaning of the figure be intelligible or not. But it is possible to employ such
                    <hi rend="italic">figuress</hi>
                    in moderation, the primary consideration
being that they should not be too obvious. And
this fault can be avoided, if the
                    <hi rend="italic">figre</hi>
                    does not
depend on the employment of words of doubtful
or double meaning, such, for instance, as the words
which occur in the theme of the suspected daughter-in-law:
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>

                    It is important, too, that the
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    should
                    <pb xml:id="p.419"/>
                    not depend on ambiguous collocations of words (a
trick which is far more foolish than the last); an
example of this is to be found in the controversial
theme, where a father, accused of a criminal passion
for his unmarried daughter, asks her for the name
of her ravisher.
                    <quote>Who dishonoured you?</quote>
                    he says.
She replies:

                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The sense of the words depends on the punctuation,
according as we place a full-stop or a comma after

                    The facts themselves must be allowed to excite the
suspicions of the judge, and we must clear away all
other points, leaving nothing save what will suggest
the truth. In doing this we shall find emotional
appeals, hesitation and words broken by silences
most effective. For thus the judge will be led to
seek out the secret which he would not perhaps
believe if he heard it openly stated, and to believe
in that which he thinks he has found out for himself.
But however excellent our

                    they must not be
too numerous. For overcrowding will make them
obvious, and they will become ineffective without
becoming inoffensive, while the fact that we make
no open accusation will seem to be due not to
modesty, but to lack of confidence in our own cause.
In fact, we may sum up the position thus: our
figures will have most effect upon the judge when
he thinks that we use them with reluctance.

                    I
myself have come across persons whom it was impossible to convince by other means: I have even
come across a much rarer thing, namely, a case
which could only be proved by recourse to such
devices. I was defending a woman who was alleged
to have forged her husband's will, and the heirs
were stated to have given a bond
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The bond was to the effect that they would make over
the property to the wife; the existence of such a bond
proved the wife innocent, since it was a virtual confirmation
of the will, of which it showed the husband to have cognisance. But the bond was not valid in the eye of the law
and such
                        <hi rend="italic">tacita fideicommissa</hi>
                        were illegal, since the wife
could not inherit; consequently the admission of the existence of the bond would have involved the loss of the inheritance, which on information being laid (cp.
                        <hi rend="italic">delatores</hi>
                        ) would
have lapsed to the state.
                        <hi rend="italic">Caput</hi>
                        is the civil status of the
wife. With regard to
                        <hi rend="italic">dicebantur,</hi>
                        the writing is careless, as
it suggests that the statement was made by the prosecution,
which was, of course, not the case.
                    </note>
                    to the husband
on his deathbed, which latter assertion was true.
                    <milestone n="74" unit="section"/>
                    For since the wife could not legally be appointed
                    <pb xml:id="p.421"/>
                    his heir, this procedure was adopted to enable the
property to be transferred to her by a secret conveyance in trust. Now it was easy for me to secure
the woman's acquittal, by openly mentioning the
existence of the bond; but this would have involved
her loss of the inheritance. I had, therefore, to plead
in such a way that the judges should understand that
the bond had actually been given, but that informers
might be unable to avail themselves of any statement of mine to that effect. And I was successful
in both my aims. The fear of seeming to boast my
own skill would have deterred me from mentioning
this case, but for the fact that I wished to demonstrate that there was room for the employment of
these
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    even in the courts.

                    Some things,
again, which cannot be proved, may, on the other
hand, be suggested by the employment of some
                    <hi rend="italic">figure.</hi>
                    For at times such hidden shafts will stick,
and the fact that they are not noticed will prevent
their being drawn out, whereas if the same point
were stated openly, it would be denied by our
opponents and would have to be proved.

                    When, however, it is respect for some person that
hampers us (which I mentioned as the second condition
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See § 66.</note>
                    under which such
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    may be used), all
the greater caution is required because the sense of
shame is a stronger deterrent to all good men than
fear. In such cases the judge must be impressed
with the fact that we are hiding what we know and
keeping back the words which our natural impulse
to speak out the truth would cause to burst from
our lips. For those against whom we are speaking,
together with the judges and our audience, would
                    <pb xml:id="p.423"/>
                    assuredly be all the more incensed by such toying
with detraction, if they thought that we were
inspired by deliberate malice.
                    <milestone n="77" unit="section"/>
                    And what difference
does it make how we express ourselves, when both
the facts and our feelings are clearly understood?
And what good shall we do by expressing ourselves thus except to make it clear that we are
doing what we ourselves know ought not to be done?
And yet in the days when I first began to teach
rhetoric, this failing was only too common. For
declaimers selected by preference those themes
which attracted them by their apparent difficulty,
although as a matter of fact they were much easier
than many others.
                    <milestone n="78" unit="section"/>
                    For straightforward eloquence
requires the highest gifts to commend itself to
the audience, while these circuitous and indirect
methods are merely the refuge of weakness, for those
who use them are like men who, being unable to
escape from their pursuers by speed, do so by
doubling, since this method of expression, which
is so much affected, is really not far removed from
jesting. Indeed it is positively assisted by the
tact that the hearer takes pleasure in detecting
the speaker's concealed meaning, applauds his own
penetration and regards another man's eloquence as
a compliment to himself.
                    <milestone n="79" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently it was not
merely in cases where respect for persons prevented
direct speaking (a circumstance which as a rule calls
for caution rather than
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    ) that they would
have recourse to
                    <hi rend="italic">figurative</hi>
                    methods, but they made
room for them even under circumstances where they
were useless or morally inadmissible, as for example
in a case where a father, who had secretly slain his
son whom he suspected of incest with his mother,
                    <pb xml:id="p.425"/>
                    and was accused of ill-treating his wife, was made to
bring indirect insinuations against his wife.

                    But
what could be more discreditable to the accused than
that he should have kept such a wife? What could
be more damaging than that he who is accused
because he appears to have harboured the darkest
suspicions against his wife, should by his defence
confirm the charge which he is required to refute?
If such speakers had only placed themselves in the
position of the judges, they would have realised how
little disposed they would have been to put up with
pleading on such lines, more especially in cases
where the most abominable crimes were insinuated
against parents.

                    However, since we have lighted on this topic, let
us devote a little more time to considering the
practice of the schools. For it is in the schools that
the orator is trained, and the methods adopted in
pleading ultimately depend on the methods employed
in declamation. I must therefore say something
of those numerous cases in which
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    have been
employed which were not merely harsh, but actually

                    insinuations against the
son, on the assumption that the father would, when
tortured, be likely to name him as one of his accomplices. But what could be more foolish? For as
                    <pb xml:id="p.427"/>
                    soon as the judges grasp their point, they will either
refuse to put him to the torture in view of his
motive for desiring to be tortured, or will refuse to
believe any confession he may make under torture.
But, it will be urged,
                    <milestone n="83" unit="section"/>
                    it is possible that this was his
motive. May be. But he should then disguise his
motive, in order that he may effect his purpose.
But what will it profit us (and by
                    <hi rend="italic">us</hi>
                    I mean
the declaimers) to have realised this motive, unless
we declare it as well? Well, then, if the case
were being actually pleaded in the courts, should we
have disclosed this secret motive in such a way?
Again, if this is not the real motive, the condemned
man may have other reasons for opposing his son;
he may think that the law should be carried out
or be unwilling to accept such a kindness from the
hands of his accuser, or (and this is the line on which
I personally should insist) he may intend to persist
in declaring his innocence even under torture.
                    <milestone n="84" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently the usual excuse advanced by such
declaimers to the effect that the inventor of the
theme meant the defence to proceed on these lines,
will not always serve their purpose. It is possible
that this was not the inventor's wish. However, let
us assume that it was. Are we then to speak like
fools merely because he thought like a fool? Personally I hold that, even in actual cases, we should
often disregard the wishes of the litigant.

                    Further,
in such cases speakers fall into the frequent error of
assuming that certain persons say one thing and
mean another: this is more especially the case where
it is assumed that a man asks permission to die.
Take, for example, the following controversial theme.

himself like a hero in the same battle, asks for his
father's pardon as a reward. The father opposes

                    I laugh at the fears which they manifest
on his behalf, as though they were in peril of death
themselves, and at the way in which they allow their
terror to influence their line of pleading; for they
forget how many precedents there are for suicide
and how many reasons there may be why a hero
turned deserter should wish for death.

                    But it would
be waste of time to expatiate on one controversial
theme. I would lay it down as a general rule that an
orator should never put forward a plea that is tantamount to collusion, and I cannot imagine a lawsuit
arising in which both parties have the same design,
nor conceive that any man who wishes to live could
be such a fool as to put forward an absurd plea for
death, when he might refrain from pleading for it at
all.

                    deny that there are controversial themes of this kind where
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    may
legitimately be employed, as, for example, the
following:
                    <quote>
                        A man was accused of unnatural
murder on the ground that he had killed his brother,
and it seemed probable that he would be condemned.
His father gave evidence in his defence, stating
that the murder had been committed on his orders.
The son was acquitted, but disinherited by the
                        <pb xml:id="p.431"/>
                        father.
                    </quote>
                    For in this case he does not pardon his son
entirely, but cannot openly withdraw the evidence
that he gave in the first trial, and while he does not
inflict any worse penalty than disinheritance, he does
not shrink from that. Further, the employment of
the
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    tells more heavily against the father than
is fair and less against the son.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The sense is quite uncertain. The simplest interpretation is perhaps that the father's action and the
                        <hi rend="italic">figura</hi>
                        by
which he defends himself show that his evidence in the
previous trial was false. The son has been acquitted on the
father's evidence, and the father by punishing him has put
himself in a hopelessly false position.

                    But, while no one
ever speaks against the view which he wishes to
prevail, he may wish something of greater importance than what he actually says. Thus the
disinherited son who asks his father to take back
another son whom he had exposed, and who had
been brought up by himself, on payment for his
maintenance, while he may prefer that he himself
should be reinstated, may all the same be perfectly
sincere in his demand on behalf of his brother.
Again, a kind of tacit hint may be employed, which,
                    <milestone n="90" unit="section"/>
                    while demanding the utmost rigour of the law from
the judges, suggests a loophole for clemency, not
openly, for that would imply a pledge on our part,
but by giving a plausible suspicion of our meaning.
This device is employed in a number of controversial
themes, among them the following.
                    <quote>
                        A ravisher,
unless within thirty days he secure pardon both

girl, shall be put to death. A man who has
succeeded in securing pardon from the father of the
girl, but not from his own, accuses the latter of
madness.

                    Here if the father pledges himself to
pardon him, the dispute falls to the ground. If, on
the other hand, he holds out no hope of pardon,
though he will not necessarily be regarded as mad,
he will certainly give the impression of cruelty and
will prejudice the judge against him. Latro

                    and the father reply,

which Quintilian has referred.
                    </note>
                    The elder Gallio treats the theme
with greater tenderness, as was natural to a man of
his disposition. He makes the father say,
                    <quote>Be firm, my heart, be firm. Yesterday you were made of sterner stuff.</quote>

                    Akin to this are those

                    of
which the Greeks are so fond, by means of which
they give gentle expression to unpleasing facts.
Themistocles, for example, is believed to have urged
the Athenians to commit their city to the protection
of heaven, because to urge them to abandon it would
have been too brutal an expression. Again the
statesman
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Unknown.</note>
                    who advised that certain golden images
of Victory should be melted down as a contribution
to the war funds, modified his words by saying that
they should make a proper use of their victories.
But all such devices which consist in saying one
thing, while intending something else to be understood, have a strong resemblance to
                    <hi rend="italic">allegory.</hi>

                    may best be
met. Some hold that they should always be
exposed by the antagonist, just as hidden ulcers
are laid open by the surgeon. It is true that
this is often the right course, being the only means
of refuting the charges which have been brought
against us, and this is more especially the case
when the question turns on the very point at which
the
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    are directed. But when the
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    are
merely employed as vehicles of abuse, it will sometimes even be wisest to show that we have a clear
conscience by ignoring them.

                    Nay, even if too
many figures have been used to permit us to take
such a course, we may ask our opponents, if they
                    <pb xml:id="p.435"/>
                    have any confidence in the righteousness of their
cause, to give frank and open expression to the
charges which they have attempted to suggest by
indirect hints, or at any rate to refrain from asking
the judges not merely to understand, but even to
believe things which they themselves are afraid to
state in so many words.

                    It may even at times be
found useful to pretend to misunderstand them; for
which we may compare the well known story of the

                    absolutely impossible; we may therefore lay

                    There remains the third class of figure designed
merely to enhance the elegance of our style, for
which reason Cicero expresses the opinion that such

                    is to indicate one thing by allusion to another; take
the case where a rival candidate speaks against an
ex-tyrant who had abdicated on condition of his
receiving an amnesty
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        An example of this theme is preserved in the elder
Seneca, Excerpt. controv. 5, 8. One candidate is permitted
to speak against another. A tyrant has abdicated on
condition of an amnesty and that any one who charged him
with having been a tyrant should be liable to capital punishment. The ex-tyrant stands for a magistracy. The rival
candidate speaks against him. The irony is in the last
sentence.

                    which
is much to be recommended, for as a rule the
introduction of an oath, unless it is absolutely
necessary, is scarcely becoming to a self-respecting
man. Seneca made a neat comment to this
effect when he said that oaths were for the
witness and not for the advocate. Again, the
advocate who drags in an oath merely for the sake
of some trivial rhetorical effect, does not deserve
much credit, unless he can do this with the
masterly effect achieved by Demosthenes, which I
mentioned above.

                    <hi rend="italic">Figures of speech</hi>
                    have always been liable to
change and are continually in process of change in
accordance with the variations of usage. Consequently when we compare the language of our
ancestors with our own, we find that practically everything we say nowadays is
                    <hi rend="italic">figurative.</hi>
                    For example,
we say
                    <hi rend="italic">invidere hac re</hi>
                    for to
                    <quote>grudge a thing,</quote>
                    instead of
                    <hi rend="italic">hanc rem,</hi>
                    which was the idiom of all the
ancients, more especially Cicero, and
                    <hi rend="italic">incumbere illi</hi>
                    (to lean upon him) for
                    <hi rend="italic">incumbere in ilium, plenum vino</hi>
                    (full of wine) for
                    <hi rend="italic">plenum vini,</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italic">huic adulari</hi>
                    (to flatter
him) for
                    <hi rend="italic">hunc adulari.</hi>
                    I might quote a thousand
other examples, and only wish I could say that the
changes were not often changes for the worse.

                    But
to proceed,
                    <hi rend="italic">figures of speech</hi>
                    fall into two main
classes. One is defined as the form of language,
while the other is mainly to be sought in the
arrangement of words. Both are equally applicable
in oratory, but we may style the former rather more
grammatical and the latter more rhetorical.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                        <quote>Figures of language</quote>
                        would
perhaps be more comprehensive, but

                    </note>
                    The former originates from the same sources as
errors of language. For every

                    of this kind
would be an error, if it were accidental and not
deliberate.

                    But as a rule such
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    are defended by
authority, age and usage, and not infrequently by some
reason as well. Consequently, although they involve
a divergence from direct and simple language, they
are to be regarded as excellences, provided always
that they have some praiseworthy precedent to
follow. They have one special merit, that they relieve the tedium of everyday stereotyped speech and
save us from commonplace language.

                    If a speaker
use them sparingly and only as occasion demands,
they will serve as a seasoning to his style and

                    increase its attractions. If, on the other hand, he
strains after them overmuch, he will lose that very
charm of variety which they confer. Some figures,
however, are so generally accepted that they have
almost ceased to be regarded as figures: consequently
however frequently they may be used, they will
make less impression on the ear, just because it has
become habituated to them.

stimulate the ear by their novelty, prove cloying if

did not present themselves naturally to the speaker,

                    This is the less
surprising, since the nature of verbs is such that we
often express the active by the passive form, as in the
case of
                    <hi rend="italic">arbitror</hi>
                    (think) and
                    <hi rend="italic">suspicor</hi>
                    (suspect), and
the passive by the active, as in the case of
                    <hi rend="italic">vapulo</hi>
                    (am beaten). Consequently the interchange of the
two forms is of common occurrence, and in many
cases either form can be used: for example, we may
say
                    <hi rend="italic">luxuriatur</hi>
                    or
                    <hi rend="italic">luxuriat</hi>

                    <hi rend="italic">fluctuatur</hi>

                    <hi rend="italic">Figures</hi>
                    also occur in connexion with number,

                    is a singular noun indicating multitude. Or the

Politian's emendation in the passage as quoted here, it is
against all MSS. authority, both of Virgil and Quintilian,

                    There is also a

                    For example, we find in

                    as a rule aim not

Hence we get further developments, such as
                    <hi rend="italic">non paeniturum</hi>
                    for

                    These may have been figures when Sallust made
them; but it is a question whether they can now be
so considered, since they have met with such general
acceptance. For we are in the habit of accepting
common parlance as sufficient authority where current
phrases are concerned: for example,
                    <hi rend="italic">rebus agentibus</hi>
                    in the sense of
                    <hi rend="italic">while this was going on,</hi>

                        III. ix. 22. Quintilian appears

                        But in Plautus

                        <quote>inflict an insult,</quote>
                        and Quintilian
probably quotes the phrase in this sense. He should, however, have said

                    Under the same class of figure falls that of
addition, which, although the words added may be

find in Horace,

Both devices are employed together in the

it was Aebutius who asserted that he had reinstated the defendant, and Caecina who denied that

                    addition, omission, and the order of words, serve to
attract the attention of the audience and do not
allow it to flag, rousing it from time to time by some
specially striking figure, while they derive something
of their charm from their very resemblance to
blemishes, just as a trace of bitterness in food will
sometimes tickle the palate. But this result will
only be obtained if figures are not excessive in
number nor all of the same type or combined or
closely packed, since economy in their use, no less
than variety, will prevent the hearer being surfeited.

                    There is a more striking class of figure, which does
not merely depend on the form of the language for
its effect, but lends both charm and force to the
thought as well. The first figure of this class which
calls for notice is that which is produced by
                    <hi rend="italic">addition.</hi>
                    Of this there are various kinds. Words, for instance,
may be doubled with a view to amplification, as in

                    states what has been
done, while the second emphasises it), or to excite
pity, as in

                    The same figure may also sometimes be employed

                    the beginnings and the conclusions of sentences are
made to correspond by the use of other words with
the same meaning. Here is an example of correspondence between the beginnings:
                    <quote>
                        I would have
faced every kind of danger; I would have exposed
myself to treacherous attacks; I would have delivered
myself over to public hatred.

                    </note>
                    An example of the
correspondence of conclusions is provided by another
passage in the same speech which follows close on
that just cited:
                    <quote>For you have decided; you have passed sentence; you have given judgment.</quote>
                    Some
call this
                    <hi rend="italic">synonzmy,</hi>
                    others
                    <hi rend="italic">disjunction:</hi>
                    both terms,
despite their difference, are correct. For the words
are differentiated, but their meaning is identical.
Sometimes, again, words of the same meaning are
grouped together. For instance,
                    <quote>
                        Since this is so,
Catiline, proceed on the path which you have entered;
depart from the city, it is high time. The gates are
open, get you forth.

                    <quote>
                        He departed, he went

                        hence; he burst forth, he was gone.

                    This is regarded as a case of
                    <hi rend="italic">pleonasm</hi>
                    by Caecilius, that is to
say, as language fuller than is absolutely required,
like the phrase:

                    <quote>myself</quote>
                    is already implied by
                    <quote>I saw.</quote>
                    But
when such language is over weighted by some purely
superfluous addition, it is, as I have also pointed out
elsewhere,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">VIII. iii. 53.</note>
                    a fault; whereas when, as in this case, it
serves to make the sense stronger and more obvious,
it is a merit.
                    <quote>I saw,</quote>
                    <quote>myself,</quote>
                    <quote>before my very eyes,</quote>
                    are so many appeals to the emotion.
                    <milestone n="47" unit="section"/>
                    I cannot
therefore see why Caecilius should have stigmatised
these words by such a name, since the doubling and
repetition of words and all forms of addition may likewise be regarded as
                    <hi rend="italic">pleonasms.</hi>
                    And it is not merely
words that are thus grouped together. The same
device may be applied to thoughts of similar content.

                    it occurs when the word omitted
may be clearly gathered from the context: an
example may be found in Caelius' denunciation of
Antony:

supply
                    <hi rend="italic">coepit.</hi>
                    Or take the following passage from a

spare our modesty.

                    it is either uncertain or at least
requires an explanation of some length to show what
is suppressed, whereas in the present case only one
word, and that of an obvious character, is missing.
If this, then, is an
                    <hi rend="italic">aposiopesis,</hi>
                    all omissions will have
a claim to the title.

                    I would not even allow the
name of
                    <hi rend="italic">aposiopesis</hi>
                    to all cases where what is omitted
is left to be understood, as for example the following phrase from Cicero's letters,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    <hi rend="italic">Data Lupercalibus quo die Antonius Caesari:</hi>
                    for there, there is no real
suppression: the omission is merely playful, for there
is but one way of completing the sentence, namely
with the words
                    <hi rend="italic">diadema imposuit.</hi>
                    <milestone n="62" unit="section"/>
                    Another figure
produced by omission is that of which I have just
spoken,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">§ 50.</note>
                    when the connecting particles are omitted.
A third is the figure known as

                    in which
a number of clauses are all completed by the same
verb, which would be required by each singly if they
stood alone. In such cases the verb to which the
rest of the sentence refers may come first, as in the
following instance:
                    <hi rend="italic">Vicit pudorem lilido, timiorem audacia, rationem amentia.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    Or it may come last,
closing a number of clauses, as in the following:

                    The verb may even be placed in the middle
so as to serve both what precedes and what follows.
The same figure may join different sexes, as for
example when we speak of a male and female child

                    On the other

                    <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi>
                    when two different
constructions are combined as in the following case:

                    For although the portion of the sentence following
                    <hi rend="italic">bellum</hi>
                    ends with a participle, both clauses of the
sentence are correctly governed by

                    Another

omission, is called

                    by which we distinguish between

                    But this is entirely
dependent on definition, and therefore I have my
doubts whether it can be called a figure. Its opposite
occurs when we pass at a bound from one thing to
something different, as though from like to like; for
example:
                    <quote rend="blockquote">

                    There is a third class of
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    which attracts the
ear of the audience and excites their attention by
some resemblance, equality or contrast of words.
To this class belongs
                    <hi rend="italic">paronomasia,</hi>
                    which we call
                    <hi rend="italic">adnominatio.</hi>
                    This may be effected in different ways.
It may depend on the resemblance of one word to
another which has preceded, although the words are
in different cases. Take the following passage from
Domitius Afer's defence of Cloatilla:
                    <hi rend="italic">Mulier omnium rerum imiperita, in omnnibus rebus infelix.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    <milestone n="67" unit="section"/>
                    Or the same
word may be repeated with greater meaning, as
                    <hi rend="italic">quando homo, hostis homno.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        The meaning is obscure. As punctuated, the sense is
                        <quote>since he is a man, the man is an enemy,</quote>
                        <hi rend="italic">i. e.</hi>
                        the utterance
of some misanthrope. Or a question-mark may be placed
after
                        <hi rend="italic">homo</hi>
                        and the meaning will be
                        <quote>since he is a man, can he be an enemy?</quote>
                    </note>
                    But although I have used
these examples to illustrate something quite different,
one of them involves both
                    <hi rend="italic">emphasis</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italic">reiteration.</hi>
                    The opposite of
                    <hi rend="italic">parononasia</hi>
                    occurs when one word is
proved to be false by repetition; for instance,
                    <quote>This law did not seem to be a law to private individuals.</quote>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">In Pis.</hi>
                        xiii. 20.
                    </note>
                    Akin to this is that syled

                    <milestone n="68" unit="section"/>
                    where the
same word is used in two different meanings. When
Proculeius reproached his son with waiting for his
death, and the son replied that he was not waiting
for it, the former retorted,
                    <hi rend="italic">Well then, I ask you to wait for it.</hi>
                    Sometimes such difference in meaning
is obtained not by using the same word, but one like
it, as for example by saying that a man whom you
think
                    <hi rend="italic">dignus supplicatione</hi>
                    (worthy of supplication) is

                        and this use survives in Livy and Sallust. But in
Augustan and post-Augustan language the normal meaning
of

                    that is the transference of the meaning of one word to another. It
has, however, greater elegance when it is employed
to distinguish the exact meanings of things, as in the
following example:

                    the same is true when the meaning of verbs is reversed
by a change in the preposition with which they are
compounded: for example,
                    <hi rend="italic">Non emissus ex urbe, sed immissus in urbem esse videatur.</hi>

                    For the
sense is forcible and the sound of the two words,
which are so very different in meaning, is pleasant,
more especially since the assonance is not far fetched,
but presents itself quite naturally, one word being of
the speaker's own selection, while the other is supplied by his opponent.

                    The old orators were at
great pains to achieve elegance in the use of words
similar or opposite in sound. Gorgias carried the
practice to an extravagant pitch, while Isocrates, at
any rate in his early days, was much addicted to it.
Even Cicero delighted in it, but showed some restraint in the employment of a device which is not
unattractive save when carried to excess, and, further,
by the weight of his thought lent dignity to what
would otherwise have been mere trivialities. For
in itself this artifice is a flat and foolish affectation,
but when it goes hand in hand with vigour of
thought, it gives the impression of natural charm,
which the speaker has not had to go far to find.

                    A good effect may also
be produced by an artifice such as the following, so
long as the thought which it expresses be vigorous:

                    the correspondence between the clauses must
be exact.

                    The second form occurs when clauses
conclude alike, the same syllables being placed at
the end of each; this correspondence in the ending
of two or more sentences is called
                    <hi rend="italic">homoeoteleuton.</hi>
                    Here is an example:

                    This figure is usually, though not invariably, found in
the groups of three clauses, styled
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">tri/kwla,</foreign>
                    of which

                    But the device may be applied to four clauses or
more. The effect may even be produced by single
words; for example,

                    In the third form the
correspondence is produced by the use of similar
cases; it is known as
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">o(moio/ptwton</foreign>
                    But this name,
though it implies a certain similarity, does not necessarily involve identity in termination, since it means
no more than similarity of case, irrespective of the
fact that words may be differently declined, and does
not always occur at the end of a sentence; the correspondence may occur at the beginning, middle or
                    <pb xml:id="p.493"/>
                    end of clauses, or may be varied so that the middle
of one clause corresponds with the beginning of
another and the end with the middle: in fact, any
arrangement of correspondences is permissible.

                    Nor
need the words which correspond consist of the
same number of syllables. For example, we find
the following sentence in Domitius Afer:

                    The best form of this
figure is that in which the beginnings and ends of

a way that there is a close resemblance between the

identical.

                    I would briefly
add that, while, suitably placed, they are a real
ornament to style, they become perfectly fatuous
when sought after overmuch. There are some
who pay no consideration to the weight of their
matter or the force of their thoughts and think
themselves supreme artists, if only they succeed in
forcing even the emptiest of words into
                    <hi rend="italic">figurative</hi>
                    form, with the result that they are never tired of
stringing
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    together, despite the fact that it
is as ridiculous to hunt for
                    <hi rend="italic">figures</hi>
                    without reference

                    must not be packed too closely together.
Changes of facial expression and glances of the eyes
are most effective in pleading, but if the orator never
ceases to distort his face with affected grimaces or to
wag his head and roll his eyes, he becomes a laughing-stock. So too oratory possesses a natural mien,
which while it is far from demanding a stolid and
immovable rigidity should as far as possible restrict
itself to the expression with which it is endowed by
nature.

place and character on each occasion of speaking.
For the majority of these figures aim at delighting the

orator who expresses his anger, his sorrow or his
entreaties in neat antitheses, balanced cadences and
exact correspondences? Too much care for our words
under such circumstances weakens the impression of
emotional sincerity, and wherever the orator displays

                    I am well aware that there are certain writers
who would absolutely bar all study of artistic structure and contend that language as it chances to
present itself in the rough is more natural and even
more manly. If by this they mean that only that
is natural which originated with nature and has
never received any subsequent cultivation, there is
an end to the whole art of oratory.

                    down. They knew nothing of introducing their
case by means of an exordium, of instructing the
jury by a statement of facts, of proving by argument
or of arousing the emotions. They lacked all these
qualifications as completely as they lacked all knowledge of the theory of artistic structure. But if
they were to be forbidden all progress in this
respect, they ought equally to have been forbidden
to exchange their huts for houses, their cloaks of
skin for civilised raiment and their mountains and
forests for cities.

                    What art was ever born fullgrown? What does not ripen with cultivation?
Why do we train the vine? Why dig it? We clear
the fields of brambles, and they too are natural products of the soil. We tame animals, and yet they
are born wild. No, that which is most natural is
that which nature permits to be done to the greatest
perfection.

                    How can a style which lacks orderly
structure be stronger than one that is welded together
and artistically arranged? It must not be regarded
as the fault of the study of structure that the employment of feet consisting of short syllables such as
characterise the Sotadean and Galliambic metres
and certain prose rhythms closely resembling them in
wildness, weakens the force of our matter.

                    Just as
river-currents are more violent when they run along a
sloping bed, that presents no obstacles to check their
course, than when their waters are broken and baffled
by rocks that obstruct the channel, so a style which
flows in a continuous stream with all the full development of its force is better than one which is rough
and broken. Why then should it be thought that
polish is inevitably prejudicial to vigour, when the
truth is that nothing can attain its full strength
                    <pb xml:id="p.511"/>

comely is his attitude? Again in fencing and all
the contests of the wrestling school, what one of all
the tricks of attack and defence is there, that does
not require movements and firmness of foot such as
can only be acquired by art?

                    Consequently in my
opinion artistic structure gives force and direction
to our thoughts just as the throwing-thong and the
bowstring do to the spear and the arrow. And
for this reason all the best scholars are convinced
that the study of structure is of the utmost value,
not merely for charming the ear, but for stirring

                    For in the first place nothing can penetrate to the emotions that stumbles at the portals of
the ear, and secondly man is naturally attracted by
harmonious sounds. Otherwise it would not be the
case that musical instruments, in spite of the fact
that their sounds are inarticulate, still succeed in
exciting a variety of different emotions in the hearer.

                    In the sacred games different methods are employed
to excite and calm the soul, different melodies are
required for the war-song and the entreaty sung by

of the trumpet that leads the army forth to battle

                    It was the undoubted custom of the Pythagoreans, when they woke from slumber, to rouse
their souls with the music of the lyre, that they
might be more alert for action, and before they
retired to rest, to soothe their minds by melodies
from the same instrument, in order that all

                    But if there is such secret power in rhythm and
melody alone, this power is found at its strongest in
eloquence, and, however important the selection
of words for the expression of our thoughts, the
structural art which welds them together in the
body of a period or rounds them off at the close,
has at least an equal claim to importance. For
there are some things which, despite triviality of
thought and mediocrity of language, may achieve
distinction in virtue of this excellence alone.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    In
fact, if we break up and disarrange any sentence
that may have struck us as vigorous, charming or
elegant, we shall find that all its force, attraction
and grace have disappeared. Cicero in his
                    <hi rend="italic">Orator</hi>
                    breaks up some of his own utterances in this way:
                    <quote>
                        <hi rend="italic">

                        Change
the order but a little so that it will run

                    and so on. Disarrange
these periods in such a manner, and you will find
that the shafts you have hurled are broken or wide
of the mark.

                    Cicero also corrects passages in the
speeches of Gracchus where the structure appears to
him to be harsh. For Cicero this is becoming enough,
but we may content ourselves with testing our own
power of welding together in artistic form the disconnected words and phrases which present themselves
to us. For why should we seek elsewhere for
examples of faults which we may all of us find in
our own work? One point, however, it is enough
simply to notice—that the more beautiful in thought
and language the sentence which you deprive of
such structural cohesion, the more hideous will
                    <pb xml:id="p.515"/>
                    be the effect upon the style, for the very brilliance
of the words at once exposes the carelessness of
their arrangement.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Accordingly, although I admit
that artistic structure, at any rate in perfection,
was the last accomplishment to be attained by
oratory, I still hold that even primitive orators
regarded it as one of the objects of their study, as
far at least as the rudeness of their attainments
permitted. For even Cicero for all his greatness
will never persuade me that Lysias, Herodotus and
Thucydides were careless in this respect.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    They
may not perhaps have pursued the same ideals as
Demosthenes and Plato, and even these latter
differed in their methods. For it would never have
done to spoil the fine and delicate texture of Lysias
by the introduction of richer rhythms, since he
would thus have lost all that surpassing grace which
he derives from his simple and unaffected tone,
while he would also have sacrificed the impression
of sincerity which he now creates. For it must be
remembered that he wrote his speeches for others
to deliver, so that it was right that they should
suggest a lack of form and artistic structure: indeed
his success in producing this effect actually shows his
mastery of structure.
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    Again history, which should
move with speed and impetuosity, would have been
ill-suited by the halts imposed by the rounding off
of the period, by the pauses for breath inevitable
in oratory, and the elaborate methods of opening
sentences and bringing them to a close. It is however true that in the speeches inserted by historians
we may note something in the way of balanced
cadences and antitheses. As regards Herodotus,
while his flow, in my opinion, is always gentle, his
                    <pb xml:id="p.517"/>
                    dialect has such a sweetness of its own that it even
seems to contain a certain rhythmical power hidden
within itself.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    However I shall speak of the different
ideals a little later: my immediate task is to teach
the student elementary rules which are essential if
correctness of structure is to be attained.

                    There are then in the first place two kinds of
style: the one is closely welded and woven together,
while the other is of a looser texture such as is
found in dialogues and letters, except when they
deal with some subject above their natural level,
such as philosophy, politics or the like.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    In saying
this, I do not mean to deny that even this looser
texture has its own peculiar rhythms which are perhaps the most difficult of all to analyse. For
dialogues and letters do not demand continual
                    <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi>
                    between vowels or absence of rhythm, but on
the other hand they have not the flow or the compactness of other styles, nor does one word lead up
so inexorably to another, the structural cohesion
being loose rather than non-existent.
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    Again in
legal cases of minor importance a similar simplicity
will be found to be most becoming, a simplicity,
that is to say, that does not dispense with rhythm
altogether, but uses rhythms of a different kind,
conceals them and employs a certain secrecy in their
construction.
                    <milestone n="22" unit="section"/>
                    But the more closely welded style is composed of
three elements: the
                    <hi rend="italic">comma,</hi>
                    or as we call it
                    <hi rend="italic">incisum,</hi>
                    the
                    <hi rend="italic">colon,</hi>

                    <hi rend="italic">menbrum,</hi>
                    and the

                    or
                    <hi rend="italic">conclusio.</hi>
                    Further, in all artistic structure
there are three necessary qualities,
                    <hi rend="italic">order, connexion</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italic">rhythm.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb xml:id="p.519"/>
                <p>
                    Of these we will first discuss
                    <hi rend="italic">order,</hi>
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    which must be
considered in connexion with words taken both
singly and in conjunction. Words taken singly are
known as
                    <hi rend="italic">asyndeta</hi>
                    (unconnected). In dealing with
them we must take care that our style does not
diminish in force through the fact that a weaker
word is made to follow a stronger: as, for example,
if after calling a man a despoiler of temples we were
to speak of him as a thief, or after styling him a
highwayman were to dub him an insolent fellow.
For sentences should rise and grow in force: of this
an excellent example is provided by Cicero,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">Phil.</hi>
                        II. xxv. 63.
                    </note>
                    where
he says,
                    <quote>
                        You, with that throat, those lungs, that
strength, that would do credit to a prizefighter, in
every limb of your body
                    </quote>
                    ; for there each phrase is
followed by one stronger than the last, whereas, if
he had begun by referring to his whole body, he
could scarcely have gone on to speak of his lungs
and throat without an anticlimax. There is also
another species of order which may be entitled
natural, as for example when we speak of
                    <quote>men and women,</quote>
                    <quote>day and night,</quote>
                    <quote>rising and setting,</quote>
                    in
preference to the reverse order.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    In some cases a
change in the order will make a word superfluous:
for example, we write
                    <hi rend="italic">fratres gemini</hi>
                    rather than
                    <hi rend="italic">gemini fratres</hi>
                    (twin-brothers), since if
                    <hi rend="italic">gemini</hi>
                    came
first, there would be no necessity to add
                    <hi rend="italic">fratres.</hi>
                    The
rule which some have sought to enforce that nouns
should precede verbs, and verbs adverbs, while
epithets and pronouns should follow their substantives, is a mere extravagance, since the reverse
order is often adopted with excellent effect.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    Another
piece of extravagant pedantry is to insist that the
first place should always be occupied by what is first
                    <pb xml:id="p.521"/>
                    in order of time: such an order is no doubt often the
best, but merely because previous events are often the
most important and should consequently be placed
before matters of more trivial import.
                    <milestone n="26" unit="section"/>
                    If the demands
of artistic structure permit, it is far best to end the
sentence with a verb: for it is in verbs that the
real strength of language resides. But if it results
in harshness of sound, this principle must give way
before the demands of rhythm, as is frequently the
case in the best authors of Rome and Greece. Of
course, in every case where a verb does not end the
sentence, we shall have an
                    <hi rend="italic">hyperbaton,</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See VIII. vi. 62 sqq.</note>
                    but
                    <hi rend="italic">hyperbaton</hi>
                    is an admitted
                    <hi rend="italic">trope</hi>
                    or
                    <hi rend="italic">figure,</hi>
                    and therefore is to be
regarded as an adornment.
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    For words are not cut
to suit metrical feet, and are therefore transferred
from place to place to form the most suitable combinations, just as in the case of unhewn stones their
very irregularity is the means of suggesting what
other stones they will best fit and what will supply
them with the surest resting-place. On the other
hand, the happiest effects of language are produced
when it is found possible to employ the natural
order, apt connexion and appropriate rhythm.

                    Some
transpositions are too long, as I have pointed out in
previous books,

                    while at times they involve faulty
structure, although some writers actually aim at this
vicious type of transposition, in order to create an
appearance of freedom and license, as in the following phrases from Maecenas,

It is, however,
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    not infrequently possible to give
special significance to a word by placing it at the
close of the sentence and thereby stamping and
impressing it on the mind of the hearer, whereas if
it were placed in the middle of the sentence, it
would remain unnoticed, escape the attention and be
obscured by its surroundings; the following passage
from Cicero will illustrate what I mean:
                    <hi rend="italic">ut tibi necesse esset in conspectu populi Romani vomere postridie.</hi>

                    Transfer the last word to some other position
and the effect will be decreased. For the whole
passage is made to converge to a point at the end;
the disgraceful circumstance of his being forced to
vomit has been mentioned and the audience expect
nothing more, when the orator adds yet a further
revolting feature of the case, namely that he was
still unable to retain his food the day after the
carouse.

                    Domitius Afer was in the habit of transferring words at the cadence of the sentence solely
for the purpose of harshening his rhythm, more
especially in his
                    <hi rend="italic">exordia,</hi>
                    as, for example, in his

                    To such an extent did he avoid the voluptuous
effect of soft and delicate rhythm, that he actually

of his language.

                    There is a further drawback resulting from the faulty arrangement of words, with
which we are all familiar, namely, that it leads to
ambiguity. The above remarks will, I think, suffice
as a brief summary of the points which require
notice in connexion with order. If the order is
                    <pb xml:id="p.525"/>

                    I will follow the natural order
and will begin by pointing out that there are some
blemishes so obvious that even the uneducated
regard them as worthy of censure; I refer to occasions when two consecutive words form some
unseemly expression by the coalescence of the
last syllable of the first word and the first of the
second.

                    Again, there are occasions when vowels
clash. When this happens, the language is broken
by gaps and interstices and seems to labour. The
most unpleasing effects of sound will be produced

blemishes are less noticeable where they are concerned. It is a less serious fault to place short
vowels after long, a statement which applies even
more strongly to placing short vowels before long.
But the least unsatisfactory combination is that of
two short vowels. And in all conjunctions of vowels,
the resulting sound will be proportionately soft or
harsh according as they resemble or differ from each
other in the method of utterance.

                    <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi>
                    is not to be regarded as so very terrible
a crime: in fact I do not know which is the worse

                    solicitude for correctness. For anxiety on this score
is bound to check the flow of our language and to
divert us from more important considerations.
Therefore while it is a sign of carelessness to admit
                    <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi>
                    here, there and everywhere, it is a symptom
of grovelling timidity to be continually in terror of
it, and there is good reason for the view that all the
followers of Isocrates and more especially Theopompus
pay accessive attention to the avoidance of this

more smoothly than if every word closed with its
own vowel, while sometimes
                    <hi rend="italic">hiatus</hi>
                    may even prove
becoming and create an impression of grandeur, as
in the following case,

perceptible pause.

                    Again it is a blemish to have too many monosyllables in succession, since the inevitable result is
that, owing to the frequency of the pauses, the
rhythm degenerates into a series of jerks. For the
same reason we must avoid placing a number of
short verbs and nouns in succession; the converse
also is true as regards long syllables, since their
accumulation makes our rhythm drag. It is a fault
of the same class to end a number of successive
sentences with similar cadences, terminations and
inflexions.

                    It is likewise inartistic to accumulate

                    ),
or metres, that is, a certain measure. Now though
both rhythm and metre consist of feet, they differ in
more than one respect.

                    For in the first place rhythm
consists of certain lengths of time, while metre is
determined by the order in which these lengths are
arranged. Consequently the one seems to be concerned with quantity and the other with quality.
Rhythm may depend on equal balance,

two short, (there are it is true other feet of which

                    while even
boys are well aware that a long syllable is equivalent
to two beats and a short to one) or it may consist of
feet in which one portion is half as long again as the
other, as is the case with

                    being composed of one long followed by three shorts,
three shorts followed by one long or with any other
arrangement preserving the proportion of three beats
to two) or finally one part of the foot may be twice
the length of the other, as in the case of the
                    <hi rend="italic">iambus,</hi>
                    which is composed of a short followed by a long, or

                    These feet are also employed by metre, but

                    precede or
                    <pb xml:id="p.535"/>
                    follow the long; for rhythm merely takes into
account the measurement of the time, that is to say,
it insists on the time taken from its rise to its fall
being the same. The measure of verse on the other
hand is quite different; the
                    <hi rend="italic">anapaest</hi>
                    (u u _) or
                    <hi rend="italic">spondee</hi>
                    (_ _) cannot be substituted at will for the

                    nor
is it a matter of indifference whether the

                    begins or ends with short syllables.

                    Further, the
laws of metre not merely refuse the substitution of
one foot for another, but will not even admit the
arbitrary substitution of any
                    <hi rend="italic">dactyl</hi>
                    or

                    same rise and fall till they reach their end, and the
style of oratory will not stoop to be measured by
the beat of the foot or the fingers.
                    <milestone n="56" unit="section"/>
                    This fact is
clearly understood by Cicero, who frequently shows
that the sense in which he desires that prose should
be rhythmical is rather that it should not lack rhythm,
a deficiency which would stamp the author as a man
of no taste or refinement, than that it should be tied
by definite rhythmical laws, like poetry; just as,
although we may not wish certain persons to be professional gymnasts, we still do not wish them to be
absolutely ignorant of the art of gynmastics.

                    But the
rounding of the period to an appropriate close which
is produced by the combination of feet requires some
name; and what name is there more suitable than
rhythm, that is to say, the rhythm of oratory, just as

                    is the syllogism of oratory? For my
own part, to avoid incurring the calumny, from which
even Cicero was not free, I ask my reader, whenever I
speak of the rhythm of artistic structure (as I have
done on every occasion), to understand that I refer
to the rhythm of oratory, not of verse.

                    It is the task of collocation to link together the
words which have been selected, approved and handed
over to its custody. For even harsh connexions are
better than those which are absolutely valueless.
None the less I should allow the orator to select
certain words for their euphony, provided always that
their force and meaning are the same as those of
the alternative words. He may also be permitted
to add words, provided they are not superfluous, and
to omit them, provided they are not essential to the
sense, while he may employ figures to alter case and
number, since such variety is attractive in itself,

the coalescence of syllables or anything that does no

                    The most important
task, however, is to know what word is best fitted to
any given place. And the most accomplished artist
will be the man who does not arrange his words
solely with a view to rhythmic effect.

                    On the other hand the management of feet is far
more difficult in prose than in verse, first because
there are but few feet in a single line of verse which
is far shorter than the lengthy periods of prose;
secondly because each line of verse is always uniform
and its movement is determined by a single definite
scheme, whereas the structure of prose must be
varied if it is to avoid giving offence by its monotony
and standing convicted of affectation.

                    Rhythm
pervades the whole body of prose through all its
extent. For we cannot speak without employing the
long and short syllables of which feet are composed.
Its presence is, however, most necessary and most
apparent at the conclusion of the period, firstly
because every group of connected thoughts has its
natural limit and demands a reasonable interval to
divide it from the commencement of what is to
follow: secondly because the ear, after following the
unbroken flow of the voice and being carried along
down the stream of oratory, finds its best opportunity
of forming a sound judgement on what it has heard,
when the rush of words comes to a halt and gives it
                    <pb xml:id="p.543"/>
                    time for consideration.

                    Consequently all harshness
and abruptness must be avoided at this point, where
the mind takes breath and recovers its energy. It
is there that style has its citadel, it is this point that
excites the eager expectation of the audience, it is
from this that the declaimer wins all his glory.
Next to the conclusion of the period, it is the
beginning which claims the most care: for the
audience have their attention fixed on this as well.

path which leads up to it be interrupted. Hence it

                    Consequently
we must also avoid ending our periods with words
containing too many syllables.
With regard to the middle portions of our periods
we must take care not merely that they possess
internal cohesion, but also that the rhythm is neither
sluggish nor long, and above all that we do not fall
into the now fashionable fault of placing a number
of short syllables together with the result that we
produce an effect not unlike the sound of a child's
rattle.

continuous without a breathing space, there must be
such almost imperceptible pauses.

                    The appearance of a complete verse in prose has
a most uncouth effect, but even a portion of a verse
is ugly, especially if the last half of a verse occurs in
the cadence of a period or the first half at the beginning. The reverse order may on the other hand
often be positively pleasing, since at times the first
half of a verse will make an excellent conclusion,
provided that it does not cover more than a few
syllables.

                    But
the opening feet of a verse are not suited to the
opening phrases of prose: Livy provides an example
of this in his preface, which begins with the first
half of a
                    <hi rend="italic">hexameter, 'Facturusne operae premium sim:'</hi>

                    the cadence of a verse is not suitable to the
cadence of a period: compare the phrase of Cicero,

                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    which is the end of a
                    <hi rend="italic">trimeter.</hi>
                    It matters not whether we speak of a
                    <hi rend="italic">trimeter</hi>
                    or of
a
                    <hi rend="italic">senarius,</hi>
                    since the line has six feet and three beats.
The end of a
                    <hi rend="italic">hexameter</hi>
                    forms a yet worse conclusion;
compare the following passage from the letters of
Brutus:
                    <hi rend="italic">
                        neque illi malunt halbere tutores aut defensores,

                    Iambic endings
are less noticeable, because that metre is near akin
to prose. Consequently such lines often slip from
us unawares: they are specially common in Brutus
as a result of his passion for severity of style; they
are not infrequent in Asinius, and are sometimes
even found in Cicero, as for example at the very
beginning of his speech against Lucius Piso:
                    <hi rend="italic">Pro di immortales, qui hic nunc illuxit dies?</hi>

                    Equal care must
however be taken to avoid any phrase of a definitely
metrical character, such as the following passage
from Sallust:
                    <hi rend="italic">Falso queritur de natura sua.</hi>

although the language of prose is bound by certain
laws, it should appear to be free. None the less

rhythm, has not succeeded in avoiding this fault at

                    But, having stated that all prose rhythm consists
of feet, I must say something on these as well.
Different names are given to these feet, and it is
necessary to determine what we shall call each of
them. For my part I propose to follow Cicero

authorities), with this exception, that in my opinion
a foot is never more than three syllables long,
whereas Cicero includes the

                    He does not, however, conceal the fact that some regard these as
rhythms rather than feet: and they are right in so
doing, since whatever is longer than three syllables
involves more than one foot. Since then there are
four feet which consist of two syllables, and eight
composed of three, I shall call them by the following
names: two long syllables make a

                    Every
one of these feet is employed in prose, but those
which take a greater time to utter and derive a
certain stability from the length of their syllables
produce a weightier style, short syllables being best
adapted for a nimble and rapid style. Both types
are useful in their proper place: for weight and
slowness are rightly condemned in passages where
speed is required, as are jerkiness and excessive
speed in passages which call for weight.

                    It may
also be important to remark that there are degrees
of length in long syllables and of shortness in short.
Consequently, although syllables may be thought
never to involve more than two time-beats or less
than one, and although for that reason in metre all
shorts and all longs are regarded as equal to other
shorts and longs, they none the less possess some
undefinable and secret quality, which makes some
seem longer and others shorter than the normal.
Verse, on the other hand, has its own peculiar
features, and consequently some syllables may be
either long or short.

                    Indeed, since strict law
allows a vowel to be long or short, as the case may
be, when it stands alone, no less than when one or

                    more consonants precede it, there can be no doubt,
when it comes to the measuring of feet, that a short
syllable, followed by another which is either long
or short, but is preceded by two consonants, is
lengthened, as for example in the phrase
                    <hi rend="italic">agrestem tenui musam.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    are short, but
the latter lengthens the former, thereby transferring
to it something of its own time-length. But how
can it do this, unless it possesses greater length
than is the portion of the shortest syllables, to
which it would itself belong if the consonants
                    <hi rend="italic">st</hi>
                    were removed? As it is, it lends one time-length
to the preceding syllable, and subtracts one from
that which follows.

                        This theory involves the allotment of a time-value to

                        gives the time-value of
                        <hi rend="italic">gr</hi>
                        to
                        <hi rend="italic">a,</hi>
                        and itself
borrows an equivalent time-value from
                        <hi rend="italic">st.</hi>
                        This view is
more explicitly expressed by the fifth-century grammarian
Pompeius (112. 26k), who allots the value of half a time-length to each consonant. Therefore to ă (= one time-length)
are added the two half time-lengths represented by
                        <hi rend="italic">gr</hi>
                        (see

                    I am, however, surprised that scholars of the
highest learning should have held the view that some
feet should be specially selected and others condemned for the purposes of prose, as if there were
any foot which must not inevitably be found in
prose. Ephorus may express a preference for the

                    but for all they say, these feet will force
themselves upon them against their will, and it will
not always be possible for them to employ the

                    or their beloved

                    which they select for special
praise because it so rarely forms part of a verse rhythm. It is not, however, the words which cause
some feet to be of more common occurrence than
others; for the words cannot be increased or
diminished in bulk, nor yet can they, like the notes
in music, be made short or long at will; everything
depends on transposition and arrangement.
                    <milestone n="90" unit="section"/>
                    For a
large proportion of feet are formed by the connexion
or separation of words, which is the reason why
several different verses can be made out of the same
words: for example, I remember that a poet of no
small distinction writing the following line:
                    <quote rend="blockquote">
                        <l part="N">Astra tenet caelum, mare classes, area messem,</l>

                            <hi rend="italic">messem area, classes mare, caelum tenet astra</hi>
                            is identical in scansion with the Sotadean
which follows, save that it opens with a
                            <hi rend="italic">spondee</hi>
                            instead of an

                        </note>
                    </quote>
                    a line which, if the order of the words be reversed,
becomes a Sotadean; again, the following Sotadean,
if reversed, reads as as an
                    <hi rend="italic">iambic trimeter:</hi>

                    while care must be
taken that the majority are of a pleasing character,
and that the inferior feet are lost in the surrounding
crowd of their superior kindred. The nature of
letters and syllables cannot be changed, but their
adaptability to each other is a consideration of no
small importance. Long syllables, as I have said,
                    <pb xml:id="p.559"/>
                    carry the greater dignity and weight, while short
syllables create an impression of speed: if the latter
are intermixed with a few long syllables, their gait
will be a run, but a gallop if they are continuous.
                    <milestone n="92" unit="section"/>
                    When a short syllable is followed by a long the effect
is one of vigorous ascent, while a long followed by a
short produces a gentler impression and suggests
descent. It is therefore best to begin with long
syllables, though at times it may be correct to begin
with short, as in the phrase
                    <hi rend="italic">novum crimen:</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    </note>
                    a gentler
effect is created, if we commence with two shorts,
as in the phrase
                    <hi rend="italic">animadverti iudices:</hi>
                    but this opening, which comes from the

                    Similarly
the conclusion of a sentence is stronger when long
syllables preponderate, but it may also be formed
of short syllables, although the quantity of the final
syllable is regarded as indifferent. I am aware that
a concluding short syllable is usually regarded as
equivalent to a long, because the time-length which
it lacks appears to be supplied from that which
follows. But when I consult my own ears I find
that it makes a great difference whether the final
syllable is really long or only treated as the equivalent of a long. For there is not the same fullness
of rhythm in

                    But if it makes no difference
whether the final syllable be long or short, the concluding feet in these two instances must be identical:
and yet somehow or other one gives the impression
of sitting down and the other of a simple halt.
This fact has led some critics to allow three timebeats for a final long syllable, adding the extra
                    <pb xml:id="p.561"/>
                    time-length which a short syllable derives from its
position at the end of a sentence to the long syllable
as well. And it not merely makes a difference with
what foot a sentence ends, but the penultimate
foot is also of importance.

                    It is not, however,
necessary to go back further than three feet, and
only that if the feet contain less than three syllables,
for we must avoid the exactitude of verse: on the
other hand, we must not go back less than two:
otherwise we shall be dealing with a foot and not
with rhythm. But in this connexion the
                    <hi rend="italic">dichoreus</hi>
                    may be regarded as one foot, if indeed a foot consisting of two
                    <hi rend="italic">chorei</hi>
                    can be considered as a single foot.

                    The same is true of the

                    composed of the

                    formed of three shorts followed
by a long, to which the conclusion is specially
dedicated. It is of these two forms that writers on
rhythm generally speak. Some, however, call all
feet containing three short syllables and a long by
the name of
                    <hi rend="italic">paean,</hi>
                    irrespective of the position of
the long syllable, and merely taking into account the
total number of time-lengths that it contains.

                    <hi rend="italic">cretic,</hi>
                    forms a solid and
severe conclusion. The
                    <hi rend="italic">spondee,</hi>
                    so frequently employed in this position by Demosthenes, is used with

                    Again there
is a point, of the importance of which I spoke above,
namely that it makes a considerable difference
whether two feet are contained in a single word
                    <pb xml:id="p.563"/>
                    or whether they are both detached. Thus
                    <hi rend="italic">criminis causa</hi>
                    makes a strong and

                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">See § 64.</note>
                    a weak ending, while tile weakness is still further increased if
the first foot be a

                    as for instance in words
like
                    <hi rend="italic">facilitates</hi>
                    or

                    <milestone n="98" unit="section"/>
                    For the mere fact that
words are separated from each other involves an
imperceptible length of time: for instance, the
                    <hi rend="italic">spondee</hi>
                    forming the middle foot of a
                    <hi rend="italic">pentameter</hi>
                    must
consist of the last syllable of one word and the first
of another, otherwise the verse is no verse at all.
It is permissible, though less satisfactory, for the
                    <hi rend="italic">spondee</hi>
                    to be preceded by an

                    which is a syllable less in length than
both of them, thus making one short syllable precede three long. But it is also perfectly correct to
place a

is adapted for use in the conclusion provided that it
be preceded by a short syllable, though it does not

words is the same would account for the disappearance of
one of them. The corruption may easily lie deeper still.
But as the words quoted come from an actual speech of
Cicero, the error is not likely to lie in the quotation,

lack the stability required for the cadence, and
should as a rule only be employed in cases where
speed is required and there is no marked pause at
the ends of the sentences.

                    Prose-structure, of
course, existed before rhythms were discovered in
it, just as poetry was originally the outcome of a
natural impulse and was created by the instinctive
feeling of the ear for quantity and the observation of
time and rhythm, while the discovery of feet came
later. Consequently assiduous practice in writing will
be sufficient to enable us to produce similar rhythmical
effects when speaking extempore.
                    <milestone n="115" unit="section"/>
                    Further it is not so
important for us to consider the actual feet as the
                    <pb xml:id="p.573"/>
                    general rhythmical effect of the period, just as the
poet in writing a verse considers the metre as a
whole, and does not concentrate his attention on the
six or five individual feet that constitute the verse.
For poetry originated before the laws which govern
it, a fact which explains Ennius' statement
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

held by versification in poetry.

                <p>
                    The best judge as to rhythm is the ear, which
appreciates fullness of rhythm or feels the lack of it,
is offended by harshness, soothed by smooth and
excited by impetuous movement, and approves
stability, while it detects limping measures and
rejects those that are excessive and extravagant.
It is for this reason that those who have received a
thorough training understand the theory of artistic
structure, while even the untrained derive pleasure
from it.
                    <milestone n="117" unit="section"/>
                    There are some points, it is true, which are
beyond the power of art to inculcate. For example
if the case, tense or mood with which we have
begun, produces a harsh rhythm, it must be changed.
But is it possible to lay down any definite rule as to
what the change of case, tense or mood should be?
It is often possible to help out the rhythm when it
is in difficulties by introducing variety through the
agency of a
                    <hi rend="italic">figure.</hi>
                    But what is this
                    <hi rend="italic">figure</hi>
                    to be?
                    <hi rend="italic">A figure of speech</hi>
                    or a
                    <hi rend="italic">figure of thought?</hi>
                    Can we
give any general ruling on the subject? In such
cases opportunism is our only salvation, and we must
be guided by consideration of the special circumstances.

                    Further with regard to the time-lengths,

                    <pb xml:id="p.575"/>
                    regulated save that of the ear? Why do some
sentences produce a full rhythmical effect, although
the words which they contain are few, whereas others
containing a greater number are abrupt and short in
rhythm? Why again in periods do we get an
impression of incompleteness, despite the fact that
the sense is complete?

to say
                    <hi rend="italic">sermonem vulgifuisse,</hi>
                    which would have satisfied
the bare demands of rhythm? I cannot tell, and yet
my ear tells me that the rhythm would have lacked
fullness without the reduplication of the phrase.

                    The
answer is that in such cases we must rely on feeling.
It is possible to have an inadequate understanding of
what it is precisely that makes for severity or charm,
but yet to produce the required effect better by
taking nature for our guide in place of art: none
the less there will always be some principle of art
underlying the promptings of nature.

                    It is, however, the special duty of the orator to
realise when to employ the different kinds of
rhythm. There are two points which call for
consideration if he is to do this with success. The
one is concerned with feet, the other with the
general rhythm of the period which is produced
by their combination. I will deal with the latter
first. We speak of
                    <hi rend="italic">commata, cola</hi>
                    and periods.

                    <hi rend="italic">A comma,</hi>
                    in my opinion, may be defined as the
expression of a thought lacking rhythmical
                    <pb xml:id="p.577"/>
                    completeness; on the other hand, most writers regard it
merely as a portion of the
                    <hi rend="italic">colon.</hi>
                    As an example I
may cite the following from Cicero:
                    <hi rend="italic">Domus tibi deerat? at habebas: pecunia superabat? at egebas.</hi>

                    a sentence which Cicero
regards as unusually concise. Thus as a rule

                    It has two forms. The

in a number of words, duly rounded to a close. The

                    but it often contains
even more. According to Cicero,

the compass of a single breath. It is further essential
that it should complete the thought which it expresses. It must be clear and intelligible and must

of instability.

                    by preference when
narrating facts, or relax the texture of our periods
by considerable pauses and looser connexions, always
excepting those passages in which narration is
designed for decorative effect and not merely for
the instruction of the audience, as for example the
passage in the Verrines where Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Verr. IV. xlviii. 106.</note>
                    tells the story
of the Rape of Proserpine: for in such cases a smooth
and flowing texture is required.

                    The full periodic
style is well adapted to the
                    <hi rend="italic">exordium</hi>
                    of important
cases, where the theme requires the orator to express
anxiety, admiration or pity: the same is true of
                    <hi rend="italic">commonplaces</hi>
                    and all kinds of

                    But it
should be severe when we are prosecuting and
expansive in panegyric. It is also most effective in
the

                    But we must only employ this form
of rhythmical structure in its full development, when
the judge has not merely got a grasp of the matter,
but has been charmed by our style, surrendered
himself to the pleader and is ready to be led whither
we will, by the delight which he experiences.
History does not so much demand full, rounded
rhythms as a certain continuity of motion and connexion of style. For all its

                    together, while the fluidity of its style gives it great
variety of movement; we may compare its motion
to that of men, who link hands to steady their steps,
and lend each other mutual support.

                    and
                    <hi rend="italic">deliberative</hi>
                    oratory will vary the arrangement of their words in
conformity with the variety of their themes.
I must now turn to discuss the first of the two
points which I mentioned above.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Sect. 121.</note>
                    No one will deny
that some portions of our speech require a gentle
flow of language, while others demand speed,
sublimity, pugnacity, ornateness or simplicity, as
the case may be,
                    <milestone n="131" unit="section"/>
                    or that long syllables are best
adapted to express dignity, sublimity and ornateness.
That is to say, while the gentler form of utterance
requires length of vowel sounds, sublime and ornate
language demands sonority as well. On the other
hand, passages of an opposite character, such as those
in which we argue, distinguish, jest or use language
approximating to colloquial speech, are better served
by short syllables.
                    <milestone n="132" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently in the
                    <hi rend="italic">exordium</hi>
                    we shall vary our structure to suit the thought.
For I cannot agree with Celsus, when he would
impose a single stereotyped form upon the
                    <hi rend="italic">exordium</hi>
                    and asserts that the best example of the structure
required for this purpose is to be found in Asinius:
e.
                    <hi rend="italic">
                        g., si, Caesar, ex omnibus mortalibus, qui sunt ac

                            If, Caesar, one man of all that are or have ever been could

                    <milestone n="133" unit="section"/>
                    I do not for a moment
deny that the structure of this passage is excellent,
but I refuse to admit that the form of rhythmical
structure which it exemplifies should be forced on all
                    <hi rend="italic">exordia.</hi>
                    For there are various ways in which the
                    <pb xml:id="p.583"/>
                    judge's mind may be prepared for what is to come:
at times we appeal for pity, at others take up a
modest attitude, while we may assume an air of
energy or dignity, flatter our audience, attempt to
alter their opinions and exhort them to give us their
best attention, according as the situation may demand.
And as all these methods are different by nature, so
each requires a different rhythmical treatment. Did
Cicero employ similar rhythms in his
                    <hi rend="italic">exordia</hi>
                    to the
                    <hi rend="italic">pro Milone,</hi>
                    the
                    <hi rend="italic">pro Cluentio</hi>
                    and the
                    <hi rend="italic">pro Ligario?</hi>
                    <milestone n="134" unit="section"/>
                    The
                    <hi rend="italic">statement of fact</hi>
                    as a rule requires slower and
what I may be allowed to call more modest feet;
and the different kinds of feet should, as far as
possible, be intermixed. For while the style of this
portion of our speech is generally marked by restraint
of language, there are occasions when it is called
upon to soar to greater heights, although on the
other hand its aim will at all times be to instruct the
audience and impress the facts upon their minds, a
task which must not be carried out in a hurry. Indeed
my personal opinion is that the
                    <hi rend="italic">statement of fact</hi>
                    should be composed of long
                    <hi rend="italic">cola</hi>
                    and short
                    <hi rend="italic">periods.</hi>
                    Arguments,
                    <milestone n="135" unit="section"/>
                    inasmuch as they are characterised by
energy and speed, will employ the feet best adapted
to these qualities. They will not however acquire
rapidity at the expense of force by employing
                    <hi rend="italic">trochees,</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">Trochee</hi>

                    </note>
                    but will rather make use of those feet which
consist of a mixture of long and short syllables,
though the long should not outnumber the short.
Lofty passages,
                    <milestone n="136" unit="section"/>
                    which employ long and sonorous
vowels, are specially well served by the amplitude of
the
                    <hi rend="italic">dactyl</hi>
                    and the
                    <hi rend="italic">paean,</hi>
                    feet which, although they
contain a majority of short syllables, are yet not
deficient in time-length. On the other hand, where
                    <pb xml:id="p.585"/>
                    violence is required, the requisite energy will be
best secured by the employment of the
                    <hi rend="italic">iambus,</hi>
                    not
merely because that foot contains but two syllables,
with the result that its beat is more frequent, making
it unsuited to gentle language, but also because every
foot gives the effect of an ascent, as they climb and
swell from short to long, a fact which renders them
superior to the
                    <hi rend="italic">choreus,</hi>
                    which sinks from long to
short.

                    Subdued passages, such as occur in the
                    <hi rend="italic">peroration,</hi>
                    also require slow syllables, which must,
however, be less sonorous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Celsus insists that there is a special form of rhythmical structure which produces a particularly stately
effect: I do not know to what he refers and, if I did,
should not teach it, since it must inevitably be slow
and flat, that is to say unless this quality is derived
from the words and thoughts expressed. If it is to
be sought for its own sake, independent of such
considerations, I cannot sufficiently condemn it.
But, to bring this discussion to a close,
                    <milestone n="138" unit="section"/>
                    I would
remark that our rhythm must be designed to suit
our delivery. Is not our tone subdued as a rule in
the
                    <hi rend="italic">exordium,</hi>
                    except of course in cases of accusation
where we have to rouse the judge or fill him with
indignation, full and clear in the
                    <hi rend="italic">statement of</hi>
                    fact,
in argument impetuous and rapid not merely in our
language, but in our motions as well, expansive and
fluent in
                    <hi rend="italic">commonplaces</hi>
                    and descriptions and, as a rule,
submissive and downcast in the
                    <hi rend="italic">peroration?</hi>
                    <milestone n="139" unit="section"/>
                    But the
motions of the body also have their own appropriate
rhythms, while the musical theory of rhythm determines the value of metrical feet no less for dancing
than for tunes. Again, do we not adapt our voice
and gesture to the nature of the themes on which
                    <pb xml:id="p.587"/>
                    we are speaking? There is, therefore, all the less
reason for wonder that the same is true of the feet
employed in prose, since it is natural that what is
sublime should have a stately stride, that what is
gentle should seem to be led along, that what
is violent should seem to run and what is tender to
flow.

                    if the choice were forced
upon me, I should prefer my rhythm to be harsh and
violent rather than nerveless and effeminate, as it is
in so many writers, more especially in our own day,
when it trips along in wanton measures that suggest
the accompaniment of castanets. Nor will any
rhythm ever be so admirable that it ought to be
                    <pb xml:id="p.589"/>
                    continued with the same recurrence of feet.

                    For we
shall really be indulging in a species of versification
if we seek to lay down one law for all varieties of
speech: further, to do so would lay us open to the
charge of the most obvious affectation, a fault of
which we should avoid even the smallest suspicion,
while we should also weary and cloy our audience by
the resulting monotony; the sweeter the rhythm,
the sooner the orator who is detected in a studied
adherence to its employment, will cease to carry
conviction or to stir the passions and emotions. The
judge will refuse to believe him or to allow him to
excite his compassion or his anger, if he thinks that
he has leisure for this species of refinement.
                    <milestone n="144" unit="section"/>
                    It will
therefore be desirable from time to time that in
certain passages the rhythm should be deliberately
dissolved: this is a task of no small difficulty, if the
appearance of effort is to be avoided. In so doing
we must not come to the assistance of the rhythm
by introducing
                    <hi rend="italic">bhyperhata</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">Transpositions. See VII. vi. 62.</note>
                    of extravagant length, for
fear that we should betray the purpose of our action:
and we should certainly never in our search for
smoothness abandon for another any word that is
apt and appropriate to our theme.
                    <milestone n="145" unit="section"/>
                    As a matter of
fact no word will be so intractable as to baffle all our
attempts to find it a suitable position; but it must
be remembered that when we avoid such words, we
do so not to enhance the charm of our rhythm, but
to evade a difficulty. I am not, however, surprised
that Latin writers have paid more attention to
rhythmical structure than the Athenians, since Latin
words possess less correctness and charm.
                    <milestone n="146" unit="section"/>
                    Nor again
do I account it a fault in Cicero that, in this respect,
he diverged to some extent from the practice of
                    <pb xml:id="p.591"/>
                    Demosthenes. However, my final book will explain
the nature of the difference between our language
and that of Greece.

                    But I must bring this book to a conclusion without
more delay, since it has already exceeded the limits
designed for it. To sum up then, artistic structure
must be decorous, pleasing and varied.

                    It consists
of three parts, order, connexion and rhythm. The
method of its achievement lies in addition, subtraction
and alteration of words. Its practice will depend
upon the nature of our theme. The care which it
demands is great, but, still, less than that demanded
by expression and thought. Above all it is necessary
to conceal the care expended upon it so that our
rhythms may seem to possess a spontaneous flow, not
to have been the result of elaborate search or
compulsion.
