                    who have held that the sole duty of the
orator was to instruct: in their view appeals to the
emotions were to be excluded for two reasons, first
on the ground that all disturbance of the mind was
a fault, and secondly that it was wrong to distract
the judge from the truth by exciting his pity, bringing influence to bear, and the like. Further, to seek
to charm the audience, when the aim of the orator
was merely to win success, was in their opinion not
only superfluous for a pleader, but hardly worthy of
a self-respecting man.

                    The majority however, while
admitting that such arts undoubtedly formed part of
oratory, held that its special and peculiar task is to
make good the case which it maintains and refute
that of its opponent.

                    Whichever of these views is
correct (for at this point I do not propose to express
my own opinion), they will regard this book as
serving a very necessary purpose, since it will deal
entirely with the points on which they lay such
stress, although all that I have already said on the
subject of judicial causes is subservient to the same
end.

                    not absolutely necessary. With regard
to the rules to be observed in this connexion, we
shall, I think, be wisest to follow our previous method
of classification and show first what is common to all
cases and then proceed to point out those which are
peculiar to the several kinds of cases.

                    1. To begin with it may be noted that the division laid down by Aristotle
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">Rhet.</hi>

                    has met with almost
universal approval. It is to the effect that there are
some proofs adopted by the orator which lie outside
the art of speaking, and others which he himself
deduces or, if I may use the term, begets out of his
case. The former therefore have been styled
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">a)/texnoi</foreign>
                    or
                    <hi rend="italic">inartificial</hi>
                    proofs, the latter
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">e)/ntexnoi</foreign>

                    To the first class belong decisions of previous courts,
rumours, evidence extracted by torture, documents,
oaths, and witnesses, for it is with these that the
majority of forensic arguments are concerned. But
though in themselves they involve no art, all the
powers of eloquence are as a rule required to disparage
or refute them. Consequently in my opinion those
who would eliminate the whole of this class of proof
from their rules of oratory, deserve the strongest
condemnation.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    It is not, however, my intention to
embrace all that can be said for or against these views.
I do not for instance propose to lay down rules for
commonplaces, a task requiring infinite detail, but
merely to sketch out the general lines and method
                    <pb xml:id="p.159"/>
                    to be followed by the orator. The method once
indicated, it is for the individual orator not merely to
employ his powers on its application, but on the
invention of similar methods as the circumstances of
the case may demand. For it is impossible to deal
with every kind of case, even if we confine ourselves
to those which have actually occurred in the past
without considering those which may occur in the
future.

                    As regards decisions in previous courts, these
fall under three heads. First, we have matters
on which judgment has been given at some time or
other in cases of a similar nature: these are, however, more correctly termed precedents, as for
instance where a father's will has been annulled or
confirmed in opposition to his sons. Secondly,
there are judgments concerned with the case itself;
it is from these that the name
                    <hi rend="italic">praeiudicium</hi>
                    is
derived: as examples I may cite those passed
against Oppianicus
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">pro Cluent.</hi>
                        xvii.
                        <hi rend="italic">sqq.</hi>
                    </note>
                    or by the senate against Milo.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">pro Mil. v.</hi>
                    </note>
                    Thirdly, there are judgments passed on the actual
case, as for example in cases where the accused has
been deported,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Banished persons who have been accused afresh after their restoration.
                    </note>
                    or where renewed application is
made for the recognition of an individual as a free
man,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        When a slave claimed his liberty by
                        <hi rend="italic">assertio</hi>

                        The meaning is not clear. The Latin suggests that
portions of a case might be tried by two panels sitting

panels sitting conjointly. The

                    Such previous decisions are as a rule
confirmed in two ways: by the authority of those
who gave the decision and by the likeness between the
two cases. As for their reversal, this can rarely be
                    <pb xml:id="p.161"/>
                    obtained by denouncing the judges, unless they have
been guilty of obvious error. For each of those who
are trying the case wishes the decision given by
another to stand, since he too has to give judgment
and is reluctant to create a precedent that may
recoil upon himself.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently, as regards the
first two classes, we must, if possible, take refuge in
some dissimilarity between the two cases, and two
cases are scarcely ever alike in all their details.
If, however, such a course is impossible and the
case is the same as that on which the previous
decision was given, we must complain of the negligence shown in the conduct of the previous case
or of the weakness of the parties condemned,
or of undue influence employed to corrupt the
witnesses, or again of popular prejudice or ignorance
which reacted unfavourably against our client; or
else we must consider what has occurred since to
alter the aspect of the case.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    If none of these courses
can be adopted, it will still be possible to point out
that the peculiar circumstances of many trials have
led to unjust decisions; hence condemnations such
as that of Rutilius
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        Publius Rutilius Rufus condemned for extortion while

was highly honoured by the people of Asia. 91 B.C.
                    </note>
                    and acquittals such as those of
Clodius and Catiline. We must also ask the judges
to consider the facts of the case on their merits
rather than make their verdict the inevitable consequence of a verdict given by others.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    When, however, we are confronted by decrees of the senate, or
ordinances of emperors or magistrates, there is no
remedy, unless we can make out that there is some
difference, however small, between the cases, or
that the same persons or persons holding the same
powers have made some subsequent enactment reversing the former decision. Failing this, there will
be no case for judgment.

                    With regard to rumour and common report,
one party will call them the verdict of public opinion and the testimony of the world at large; the
other will describe them as vague talk based on no
sure authority, to which malignity has given birth
and credulity increase, an ill to which even the most
innocent of men may be exposed by the deliberate
dissemination of falsehood on the part of their
enemies. It will be easy for both parties to produce
precedents to support their arguments.

                    A like situation arises in the case of evidence
extracted by torture: one party will style torture an
infallible method of discovering the truth, while the
other will allege that it also often results in false
confessions, since with some their capacity of endurance makes lying an easy thing, while with others
weakness makes it a necessity. It is hardly worth
my while to say more on the subject, as the speeches
both of ancient and modern orators are full of this
topic.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Individual cases may however involve special
considerations in this connexion. For if the point at
issue is whether torture should be applied, it will
make all the difference who it is who demands or
offers it, who it is that is to be subjected to torture,
against whom the evidence thus sought will tell, and
what is the motive for the demand. If on the other
hand torture has already been applied, it will make
all the difference who was in charge of the proceedings, who was the victim and what the nature of the
torture, whether the confession was credible or consistent, whether the witness stuck to his first statement or changed it under the influence of pain, and
whether he made it at the beginning of the torture
or only after it had continued some time. The
                    <pb xml:id="p.165"/>
                    variety of such questions is as infinite as the variety
of actual cases.

                    It is also frequently necessary to speak
against documents, for it is common knowledge that
they are often not merely rebutted, but even
attacked as forgeries. But as this implies either
fraud or ignorance on the part of the signatories, it
is safer and easier to make the charge one of ignorance, because by so doing we reduce the number
of the persons accused.

whole will draw their arguments from the circumstances of the case at issue. For example, it may be
incredible that an incident occurred as stated in the
documents, or, as more often happens, the evidence
of the documents may be overthrown by other proofs
which are likewise of an
                    <hi rend="italic">inartificial</hi>
                    nature; if, for
example, it is alleged that the person, whose interests are prejudiced by the document, or one of
the signatories was absent when the document was
signed, or deceased before its signature, or if the
dates disagree, or events preceding or following the
writing of the document are inconsistent with it.
Even a simple inspection of a document is often
sufficient for the detection of forgery.

                    With regard to oaths,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        An oath might be taken by one of the parties as an
alternative to evidence. In court such an oath might be
taken only on the proposal of the adversary; the litigant
might not swear on his own initiative, although an oath
might be taken voluntarily before the case came into court.
The matter of the oath rested with the profferer, and the
taking of such a proffered oath meant victory for the
swearer.
                    </note>
                    parties either offer to
take an oath themselves, or refuse to accept the oath
of their opponent, demand that their opponent
should take an oath or refuse to comply with a
similar demand when proffered to themselves. To
offer to take an oath unconditionally without
demanding that one's opponent should likewise take
an oath is as a rule a sign of bad faith.

                    If, however,
anyone should take this course, he will defend his
action by appealing to the blamelessness of his life
                    <pb xml:id="p.167"/>
                    as rendering perjury on his part incredible, or by the
solemn nature of the oath, with regard to which he
will win all the greater credence, if without the
least show of eagerness to take the oath he makes it
clear that he does not shrink from so solemn a duty.
Or again, if the case is such as to make this possible,
he will rely on the trivial nature of the point in
dispute to win belief, on the ground that he would
not incur the risk of the divine displeasure when so
little is at stake. Or, finally, he may in addition to
the other means which he employs to win his case
offer to take an oath as a culminating proof of a
clear conscience.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    The man who refuses to accept his
opponent's offer to take an oath, will allege that the
inequality of their respective conditions are not the
same for both parties and will point out that many
persons are not in the least afraid of committing
perjury, even philosophers having been found to deny
that the gods intervene in human affairs; and further
that he who is ready to take an oath without being
asked to do so, is really proposing to pass sentence
on his own case and to show what an easy and trivial
thing he thinks the oath which he offers to take.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    On the other hand the man who proposes to put
his opponent on oath appears to act with moderation,
since he is making his adversary a judge in his own
case, while he frees the actual judge from the burden
of coming to a decision, since the latter would
assuredly prefer to rest on another man's oath than
on his own.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    This fact makes the refusal to take an
oath all the more difficult, unless indeed the affair
in question be of such a nature that it cannot be
supposed that the facts are known to the person
asked to take the oath. Failing this excuse, there
                    <pb xml:id="p.169"/>
                    is only one course open to him: he must say that
his opponent is trying to excite a prejudice against
him and is endeavouring to give the impression that
he has real ground for complaint though he is not in
a position to win his case; consequently, though a
dishonest man would eagerly have availed himself of
the proposal, he prefers to prove the truth of his
statements rather than leave a doubt in anyone's
mind as to whether he has committed perjury or no.

                    But in my young days advocates grown old in pleading used to lay it down as a rule that we should

                    It is, however, the evidence that gives the
greatest trouble to advocates. Evidence may be
given either in writing or orally by witnesses present
in court. Documentary evidence is easier to dispose
of. For it is likely that the deponent was less
ashamed of himself in the presence of a small
number of witnesses, and his absence from court is
attacked as indicating a lack of confidence. If we
cannot call the character of the deponent in question,
we may attack the witnesses to his signature.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    Further there is always a certain tacit prejudice
against documentary evidence, since no one can be
forced to give such evidence save of his own free will,
whereby he shows that he harbours unfriendly feelings towards the person against whom he bears
                    <pb xml:id="p.171"/>
                    witness. On the other hand an advocate should be
chary of denying that a friend may give true
evidence against a friend or an enemy against an
enemy, provided they are persons of unimpeachable
credit. But the subject admits of copious discussion, from whichever side it be regarded.

                    The task of dealing with the evidence of witnesses
present in court is, however, one of great difficulty,
and consequently whether defending or impugning
them the orator employs a twofold armoury in the
shape of a set speech and examination.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">Interrogatio</hi>
                        includes both the examination in chief and
cross-examination.
                    </note>
                    In set
speeches it is usual to begin with observations either
on behalf of or against witnesses in general.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    In so
doing we introduce a commonplace, since one side
will contend that there can be no stronger proof than
that which rests on human knowledge, while the
other, in order to detract from their credibility, will
enumerate all the methods by which false evidence
is usually given.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    The next procedure is the common
practice of making a special attack, which all the
same involves impugning the validity of evidence
given by large numbers of persons. We know, for
instance, that the evidence of entire nations
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">e.g.</hi>
                        in cases of extortion, where a whole province might
give evidence against the accused.
                    </note>
                    and
whole classes of evidence have been disposed of by
advocates. For example, in the case of hearsay
evidence, it will be urged that those who produce
such evidence are not really witnesses, but are
merely reporting the words of unsworn persons, while
in cases of extortion, those who swear that they paid
certain sums to the accused are to be regarded not
as witnesses, but as parties to the suit.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Sometimes
however the advocate will direct his speech against
single individuals. Such a form of attack may be
found in many speeches, sometimes embedded in
                    <pb xml:id="p.173"/>
                    the speech for the defence and sometimes published
separately like the speech against the evidence of
Vatinius.

                    The whole subject, therefore, demands a
thorough investigation, as the task which we have
in hand is the complete education of an orator.
Otherwise the two books written on this subject by
Domitius Afer would suffice. I attended his lectures
when he was old and I was young, and consequently
have the advantage not merely of having read his
book, but of having heard most of his views from
his own lips. He very justly lays down the rule that
in this connexion it is the first duty of an orator to
make himself thoroughly acquainted with the case,
a remark which of course applies to all portions of
a speech.
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    How such knowledge may be acquired I

of this work.

                    This knowledge will suggest material
for the examination and will supply weapons ready
to the speaker's hand: it will also indicate to him
the points for which the judge's mind must be
prepared in the set speech. For it is by the set speech
that the credit of witnesses should be established
or demolished, since the effect of evidence on the
individual judge depends on the extent to which he
has been previously influenced in the direction of
believing the witness or the reverse.

                    And since there are two classes of witnesses
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        In civil cases evidence was as a rule voluntary; in

who are summoned to attend in the public courts of
whom the former are available to either party, the
latter solely to the accusers, we must distinguish
between the duties of the advocate who produces
witnesses and the advocate who refutes them.

                    He who produces a voluntary witness is in a

                    position to know what he is likely to say: consequently the task of examining him would seem to
be rendered easier. But even here such cases make
a great demand on the acumen and watchfulness of
the advocate, who must see that his witness is neither
timid, inconsistent nor imprudent.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    For the opposing
counsel have a way of making a witness lose his head
or of leading him into some trap; and once a witness
trips, he does more harm to his own side than he
would have done good, had he retained his composure
and presence of mind. The advocate must therefore
put his witnesses through their paces thoroughly
in private before they appear in court and must
test them by a variety of questions such as may
well be put to them by his opponent. The result
will be that they will not contradict themselves
or, if they do make some slip, can be set upon
their feet again by a timely question from the advocate who produces them.
                    <milestone n="12" unit="section"/>
                    Still, even in the case
of witnesses whose evidence is consistent, we must
be on our guard against treachery. For such
witnesses are often put up by one's opponent and,
after promising to say everything that will help our
case, give answers of exactly the opposite character
and carry more weight by the admission of facts
which tell against us than they would have done had
they disproved them.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    We must therefore discover
what motives they have for doing our opponent a hurt,
and the fact that they were once his enemies will
not suffice our purpose: we must find out whether
they have ceased to be ill-disposed to him or whether
they desire by means of their evidence to effect a
reconciliation with him, in order to assure ourselves that they have not been bribed or repented of
                    <pb xml:id="p.177"/>
                    their previous attitude and changed their purpose.
Such precautions are necessary even with witnesses
who know that what they propose to say is true;
but it is still more necessary with those who promise
to give false evidence.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    For experience shows that
they are more likely to repent of their purpose, their
promises are less to be relied on, and, if they do keep
their promise, their evidence is easier to refute.

                    Witnesses appearing in answer to a subpoena may
be divided into two classes: those who desire to
harm the accused, and those who do not. The
accuser sometimes is aware of their disposition,
sometimes unaware. For the moment let us assume
that he is aware of their disposition, although I must
point out that in either case the utmost skill is required in their examination.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    For if an advocate is
producing a witness who is desirous of harming the
accused, he must avoid letting this desire become
apparent, and must not at once proceed to question
him on the point at issue. On the contrary this
point must be approached by a circuitous route in
such a manner as to make it seem that the statement which the witness is really desirous of making
has been forced from him. Again lie should not
press the witness too much, for fear he should impair
his credit by the glibness with which lie answers
every question, but should draw from him just so
much as may seem reasonable to elicit from a single
witness.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    On the other hand in the case of a witness
who is reluctant to tell the truth, the essential for
successful examination is to extort the truth against
his will This can only be done by putting questions
which have all the appearance of irrelevance.
If this he done, he will give replies which he
                    <pb xml:id="p.179"/>
                    thinks can do no harm to the party which he
favours, and subsequently will be led on from the
admissions which he has made to a position which
renders it impossible for him to deny the truth of
the facts which he is reluctant to state.
                    <milestone n="18" unit="section"/>
                    For just as
in a set speech we usually collect detached arguments which in themselves seem innocuous to the
accused, but taken together prove the case against
him, so we must ask the reluctant witness a number
of questions relative to acts antecedent or subsequent
to the case, places, dates, persons, etcetera, with a
view to luring him into some reply which will force
him to make the admissions which we desire or to
contradict his previous evidence.
                    <milestone n="19" unit="section"/>
                    If this fails, we
must content ourselves with making it clear that he
is reluctant to tell what he knows, and lead him
with a view to tripping him up on some point or
other, even though it be irrelevant to the case; we
must also keep him in the witness-box for an unusual
length of time, so that by saying everything that can
be said and more than is necessary on behalf of the
accused, he may be rendered suspect to the judge.
Thus he will do the accused no less harm than if he
had told the truth against him.
                    <milestone n="20" unit="section"/>
                    But if (to proceed to
our second supposition) the advocate does not know
what the intentions of the witness may be, he must
advance gradually inch by inch and sound him by
examination and lead him step by step to the particular reply which it is desired to elicit.
                    <milestone n="21" unit="section"/>
                    But since
these witnesses are sometimes so artful that their
first replies are designed to meet the wishes of the
questioner, in order to win all the greater credit
when subsequently they answer in a very different
way, it will be the duty of the advocate to dismiss
                    <pb xml:id="p.181"/>
                    a suspect witness while he can still do so with
advantage.

                    In the case of advocates for the defence examination is in some respects easier, in some more
difficult. It is more difficult because it is rarely
possible for them to have any previous knowledge of
what the witness is likely to say, and easier because,
when they come to cross-examine, they know what
he has already said.
                    <milestone n="23" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently in view of the
uncertainty involved, there is need for careful inquiry with a view to discovering the character of the
witness against the accused and what are his motives
for hostility and what its extent: and all such points
about the witness should be set forth in advance
and disposed of, whether we desire to represent the
evidence against the accused as instigated by hatred,
envy, bribery or influence. Further, if our opponents
bring forward only a small number of witnesses, we
must attack them on that head; if on the other
hand they produce an excessive number, we must
accuse them of conspiracy: if the witnesses are
persons of inconspicuous rank, we must minimise
their importance, while if they are powerful, we shall
accuse our adversaries of bringing undue influence to
bear.
                    <milestone n="24" unit="section"/>
                    It will, however, be still more helpful if we
expose the motives which they have for desiring to
injure the accused, and these will vary according to
the nature of the case and the parties concerned.
For the other lines of argument mentioned above
are often answered by the employment of commonplaces on similar lines, since the prosecutor, if he
produce but few witnesses of inconspicuous rank, can
parade the simple honesty of his methods on the
ground that he has produced none save those who
                    <pb xml:id="p.183"/>
                    are in a position to know the real facts, while if he
produce a number of distinguished witnesses, it is
even easier to commend them to the court.
                    <milestone n="25" unit="section"/>
                    But at
times, just as we have to praise individual witnesses,
so we may have to demolish them, whether their
evidence has been given in documentary form or they
have been summoned to appear in person. This was
easier and of more frequent occurrence in the days
when the examination of the witnesses was not
deferred till after the conclusion of the pleading.

                        It is not clear to what Quintilian refers. There are, it is

found are all second pleadings.
                    </note>
                    With regard to what we should say against individual

                    It remains to consider the technique to be followed
in the examination of witnesses. The first essential
is to know your witness. For a timid witness may
be terrorised, a fool outwitted, an irascible man
provoked, and vanity flattered. The shrewd and
self-possessed witness, on the other hand, must be
dismissed at once as being malicious and obstinate;
or refuted, not by cross-examination, but by a brief
speech from the counsel for the defence; or may be
put out of countenance by some jest, if a favourable
opportunity presents itself; or, if his past life admits
of criticism, his credit may be overthrown by the
scandalous charges which can be brought against him.
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    It has been found advantageous at times when confronted with an honest and respectable witness to
refrain from pressing him hard, since it is often the
case that those who would have defended themselves
manfully against attack are mollified by courtesy.
But every question is either concerned with the
case itself or with something outside the case. As
regards the first type of question counsel for the

commencing his examination with questions of an
apparently irrelevant and innocent character and
then by comparing previous with subsequent replies,
frequently lead witnesses into such a position that
it becomes possible to extort useful admissions from
them against their will.

from natural talent or practice. If, however, I am
asked to point out a model for imitation, I can
recommend but one, namely that which may be
found in the dialogues of the Socratics and more
especially of Plato, in which the questions put are
so shrewd that although individually as a rule the
answers are perfectly satisfactory to the other side,
yet the questioner reaches the conclusion at which
he is aiming.
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    Fortune sometimes is so kind that a
witness gives an answer involving some inconsistency,
while at times (and this is a more frequent occurrence)
one witness contradicts another. But acute examination methodically conducted will generally reach
the same result which is so often reached by chance.
                    <milestone n="30" unit="section"/>
                    There are also a number of points strictly irrelevant
to the case on which questions may be put with
advantage. We may for example ask questions about
the past life of other witnesses or about the witness'
own character, with a view to discovering whether
they can be charged with some disgraceful conduct,
or degrading occupation, with friendship with the
prosecutor or hostility toward the accused, since
in replying to such questions they may say something which will help our cause or may be convicted
                    <pb xml:id="p.187"/>
                    of falsehood or of a desire to injure the accused.
But above all our examination must be circumspect,
                    <milestone n="31" unit="section"/>
                    since a witness will often launch some smart repartee
in answering counsel for the defence and thereby
win marked favour from the audience in general.
Secondly, we must put our questions as far as possible
in the language of everyday speech that the witness,
who is often an uneducated man, may understand our
meaning, or at any rate may have no opportunity of
saying that he does not know what we mean, a
statement which is apt to prove highly disconcerting
to the examiner.
                    <milestone n="32" unit="section"/>
                    I must however express the
strongest disapproval of the practice of sending a
suborned witness to sit on the benches of the opposing party, in order that on being called into the
witness-box from that quarter he may thereby do all
the more damage to the case for the accused by
speaking against the party with whose adherents he
was sitting or, while appearing to help him by his
testimony, deliberately giving his evidence in such
an extravagant and exaggerated manner, as not only
to detract from the credibility of his own statements, but to annul the advantage derived from
the evidence of those who were really helpful. I
mention this practice not with a view to encourage
it, but to secure its avoidance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Documentary evidence is not frequently in conflict
with oral. Such a circumstance may be turned to
advantage by either side. For one party will rest
its case on the fact that the witness is speaking on
oath, the other on the unanimity of the signatories.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        An over-statement, since in many cases the signatories
could only testify that the statement was that actually
made by the deponent; with its truth they were not
necessarily concerned.

                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                    Again there is often a conflict between the evidence
and the arguments. One party will argue that the
witnesses know the facts and are bound by the
                    <pb xml:id="p.189"/>
                    sanctity of their oath, while the arguments are
nought but ingenious juggling with the facts. The
other party will argue that witnesses are procured by
influence, fear, money, anger, hatred, friendship, or
bribery, whereas arguments are drawn from nature;
in giving his assent to the latter the judge is believing the voice of his own reason, in accepting the
former he is giving credence to another.
                    <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>
                    Such
problems are common to a number of cases, and are
and will always be the subject of vehement debate.
Sometimes there are witnesses on both sides and the
question arises with regard to themselves as to which
are the more respectable in character, or with regard
to the case, which have given the more credible evidence, with regard to the parties to the case, which
has brought the greater influence to bear on the
witnesses.
                    <milestone n="35" unit="section"/>
                    If to this kind of evidence anyone should
wish to add evidence of the sort known as supernatural, based on oracles, prophecies and omens, I
would remind him that there are two ways in which
these may be treated. There is the general method,
with regard to which there is an endless dispute
between the adherents of the Stoics and the Epicureans, as to whether the world is governed by providence. The other is special and is concerned with
particular departments of the art of divination, according as they may happen to affect the question at issue.
                    <milestone n="36" unit="section"/>
                    For the credibility of oracles may be established
or destroyed in one way, and that of soothsayers,
augurs, diviners and astrologers in another, since
the two classes differ entirely in nature. Again the
task of establishing or demolishing such evidence as
the following will give the orator plenty to do; as
for example if certain words have been uttered under
                    <pb xml:id="p.191"/>
                    the influence of wine, in sleep or in a fit of madness,
or if information has been picked up from the mouths
of children, whom the one party will assert to be incapable of invention, while the other will assert that
they do not know what they are saying.
                    <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>
                    The following method may not merely be used with great effect,
but may even be badly missed when it is not employed.

                    Practically all these points are discussed

                    The second class of proofs are wholly the
work of art and consist of matters specially adapted
to produce belief. They are, however, as a rule almost
entirely neglected or only very lightly touched on
by those who, avoiding arguments as rugged and
repulsive things, confine themselves to pleasanter
regions and, like those who, as poets tell, were bewitched by tasting a magic herb in the land of the
Lotus-eaters or by the song of the Sirens into preferring pleasure to safety, follow the empty semblance
of renown and are robbed of that victory which is the
aim of eloquence.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    And yet those other forms of
eloquence, which have a more continuous sweep and
flow, are employed with a view to assisting and
embellishing the arguments and produce the appearance of super inducing a body upon the sinews, on
which the whole case rests; thus if it is asserted
                    <pb xml:id="p.193"/>
                    that some act has been committed under the influence of anger, fear or desire, we may expatiate
at some length on the nature of each of these
passions. It is by these same methods that we
praise, accuse, exaggerate, attenuate, describe, deter,
complain, console or exhort.
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    But such rhetorical
devices may be employed in connexion with matters
about which there is no doubt or at least which we
speak of as admitted facts. Nor would I deny that
there is some advantage to be gained by pleasing
our audience and a great deal by stirring their
emotions. Still, all these devices are more effective,
when the judge thanks he has gained a full knowledge
of the facts of the case, which we can only give him
by argument and by the employment of every other
known means of proof.

                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    Before, however, I proceed to classify the various
species of artificial proof, I must point out that there
are certain features common to all kinds of proof.
For there is no question which is not concerned
either with things or persons, nor can there be any
ground for argument save in connexion with matters
concerning things or persons, which may be considered
either by themselves or with reference to something
else;
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    while there can be no proof except such as is
derived from things consequent or things opposite,
which must be sought for either in the time preceding, contemporaneous with or subsequent to the
alleged fact, nor can any single thing be proved save
by reference to something else which must be
greater, less than or equal to it.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    As regards arguments, they may be found either in the questions
raised by the case, which may be considered by themselves quite apart from any connexion with individual
                    <pb xml:id="p.195"/>
                    things or persons, or in the case itself, when anything is discovered in it which cannot be arrived at
by the light of common reason, but is peculiar to the
subject on which judgment has to be given. Further,
all proofs fall into three classes, necessary, credible,
and not impossible.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    Again there are four forms of
proof. First, we may argue that, because one thing
is, another thing is not; as
                    <hi rend="italic">It is day and therefore not night.</hi>
                    Secondly, we may argue that, because one
thing is, another thing is; as
                    <hi rend="italic">The sun is risen, thereit is day.</hi>
                    Thirdly, it may be argued that because one
thing is not, another thing is; as
                    <hi rend="italic">It is not night, therefore it is day.</hi>
                    Finally, it may be argued that, because
one thing is not, another thing is not; as
                    <hi rend="italic">He is not a reasoning being, therefore he is not a man.</hi>
                    These
general remarks will suffice by way of introduction
and I will now proceed to details.

                    Every artificial proof consists either of indications, arguments or examples. I am well aware that
many consider indications to form part of the arguments. My reasons for distinguishing them are twofold. In the first place indications as a rule come
under the head of inartificial proofs: for a bloodstained garment, a shriek, a dark blotch and the like
are all evidence analogous to documentary or oral
evidence and rumours; they are not discovered by
the orator, but are given him with the case itself.
                    <milestone n="2" unit="section"/>
                    My second reason was that indications, if indubitable,
are not arguments, since they leave no room for
question, while arguments are only possible in
controversial matters. If on the other hand they
are doubtful, they are not arguments, but require
arguments to support them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="3" unit="section"/>
                    The two first species into which artificial proofs
                    <pb xml:id="p.197"/>
                    may be divided are, as I have already said, those
which involve a conclusion and those which do not.
The former are those which cannot be otherwise and
are called
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">tekmh/ria,</foreign>
                    by the Greeks, because they are
indications from which there is no getting away.
These however seem to me scarcely to come under
the rules of art. For where an indication is irrefutable, there can be no dispute as to facts.
                    <milestone n="4" unit="section"/>
                    This
happens whenever there can be no doubt that something is being or has been done, or when it is impossible for it to be or have been done. In such cases
there can be no dispute as to the fact. This kind of
proof may be considered in connexion with past,
present or future time.
                    <milestone n="5" unit="section"/>
                    For example, a woman who is
delivered of a child must have had intercourse with
a man, and the reference is to the past. When there
is a high wind at sea, there must be waves, and the
reference is to the present. When a man has received a wound in the heart, he is bound to die, and
the reference is to the future. Nor again can there
be a harvest where no seed has been sown, nor can
a man be at Rome when he is at Athens, nor have
been wounded by a sword when he has no scar.
Some have the same force when reversed:
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    a man
who breathes is alive, and a man who is alive breathes.
Some again cannot be reversed: because he who
walks moves it does not follow that he who moves
walks.
                    <milestone n="7" unit="section"/>
                    So too a woman, who has not been delivered
of a child, may have had intercourse with a man,
there may be waves without a high wind, and a man
may die without having received a wound in the
heart. Similarly seed may be sown without a harvest
resulting, a man, who was never at Athens, may
                    <pb xml:id="p.199"/>
                    never have been at Rome, and a man who has a scar
may not have received a sword-wound.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <milestone n="8" unit="section"/>
                    There are other indications or
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">ei)ko/ta,</foreign>
                    that is
probabilities, as the Greeks call them, which do not
involve a necessary conclusion. These may not
be sufficient in themselves to remove doubt, but
may yet be of the greatest value when taken in
conjunction with other indications.
                    <milestone n="9" unit="section"/>
                    The Latin
equivalent of the Greek
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">shmei=on</foreign>
                    is
                    <hi rend="italic">signum,</hi>
                    a sign,
though some have called it
                    <hi rend="italic">indicium,</hi>
                    an indication,
or
                    <hi rend="italic">vestigium,</hi>
                    a trace. Such signs or indications
enable us to infer that something else has happened;
blood for instance may lead us to infer that a
murder has taken place. But bloodstains on a
garment may be the result of the slaying of a victim
at a sacrifice or of bleeding at the nose. Everyone
who has a bloodstain on his clothes is not necessarily a murderer.
                    <milestone n="10" unit="section"/>
                    But although such an indication
may not amount to proof in itself, yet it may be
produced as evidence in conjunction with other
indications, such for instance as the fact that the
man with the bloodstain was the enemy of the
murdered man, had threatened him previously or
was in the same place with him. Add the indication
in question to these, and what was previously only a
suspicion may become a certainty.
                    <milestone n="11" unit="section"/>
                    On the other
hand there are indications which may be made to
serve either party, such as livid spots, swellings
which may be regarded as symptoms either of
poisoning or of bad health, or a wound in the breast
which may be treated as a proof of murder or of
suicide. The force of such indications depends on the
amount of extraneous support which they receive.

                    Hermagoras would include among such indications as do not involve a necessary conclusion, an
                    <pb xml:id="p.201"/>
                    argument such as the following,

                    If we accept this
view, I fear that we shall come to treat all inferences
from a fact as indications. None the less such arguments are in practice treated exactly as if they were
indications.
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    Nor do the Areopagites, when they
condemned a boy for plucking out the eyes of
quails, seem to have had anything else in their
mind than the consideration that such conduct
was an indication of a perverted character which
might prove hurtful to many, if he had been
allowed to grow up. So, too, the popularity of
Spurius Maelius and Marcus Manlius was regarded
as an indication that they were aiming at supreme
power.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    However, I fear that this line of reasoning
will carry us too far. For if it is an indication
of adultery that a woman bathes with men, the
fact that she revels with young men or even an
intimate friendship will also be indications of the
same offence. Again depilation, a voluptuous gait,
or womanish attire may be regarded as indications of
effeminacy and unmanliness by anyone who thinks
that such symptoms are the result of an immoral
character, just as blood is the result of a wound: for
anything, that springs from the matter under investigation and comes to our notice, may properly
be called an indication.

argument drawn either from denial of consequents or
from incompatibles

of all arguments, for what is certain cannot be
proved by what is uncertain. To all these forms of

that which provides proof Celsus indeed treats
the terms, proof, indication, credibility, attempt,

                    For proof and credibility are not
merely the result of logical processes, but may
equally be secured by inartificial arguments. Now
I have already
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">v. ix. 2.</note>
                    distinguished signs or, as he prefers
to call them, indications from arguments. Consequently, since an argument is a process of reasoning

                    which provides proof and enables one thing to be

uncertain by reference to facts which are certain,
there must needs be something in every case which
requires no proof.

                    Otherwise there will be nothing
by which we can prove anything; there must be
something which either is or is believed to be true,
by means of which doubtful things may be rendered
credible. We may regard as certainties, first, those
things which we perceive by the senses, things for
instance that we hear or see, such as signs or indications; secondly, those things about which there is
general agreement, such as the existence of the gods
or the duty of loving one's parents;
                    <milestone n="13" unit="section"/>
                    thirdly, those
things which are established by law or have passed
into current usage, if not throughout the whole
world, at any rate in the nation or state where the
case is being pleaded—there are for instance many
rights which rest not on law, but on custom; finally,
there are the things which are admitted by either
party, and whatever has already been proved or is
not disputed by our adversary.

                    Thus for instance it
may be argued that since the world is governed by
providence, the state should similarly be governed
by some controlling power: it follows that the state
must be so governed, once it is clear that the world
is governed by providence.

                    Further, the man who is
to handle arguments correctly must know the nature
and meaning of everything and their usual effects.

                    With regard to
credibility there are three degrees. First, the
highest, based on what usually happens, as for instance the assumption that children are loved by
                    <pb xml:id="p.211"/>
                    their parents. Secondly, there is the highly
probable, as for instance the assumption that a man
in the enjoyment of good health will probably live
till to-morrow. The third degree is found where
there is nothing absolutely against an assumption,
such as that a theft committed in a house was the
work of one of the household.

made a careful examination of all that commonly
happens to things and persons, and what things and
persons are naturally adverse or friendly to other
things or persons, as for instance, what is the
natural result of wealth or ambition or superstition,
what meets with the approval of good men, what is
the object of a soldier's or a farmer's desires, and by
what means everything is sought or shunned.

and it is with credibility that the great majority of
arguments are concerned, turns on questions such
as the following: whether it is credible that a father
has been killed by his son, or that a father has committed incest with his daughter, or to take questions
of an opposite character, whether it is credible that
a stepmother has poisoned her stepchild, or that a
man of luxurious life has committed adultery; or
again whether a crime has been openly committed,
or false evidence given for a small bribe, since each
of these crimes is the result of a special cast of
character as a rule, though not always; if it were

it has its usual haunts or birthplace, as even the
various kinds of fish flourish in different surroundings, some preferring a smooth and others a rocky
bottom, and are found on different shores and in
divers regions (you will for instance never catch
a sturgeon or wrasse in Italian waters), so not
every kind of argument can be derived from every
circumstance, and consequently our search requires
discrimination.

But if we know the circumstances which give rise to
each kind of argument, we shall easily see, when

                    Firstly, then, arguments may be drawn from
persons; for, as I have already said,

                    all arguments

                    Such are birth, for
persons are generally regarded as having some
resemblance to their parents and ancestors, a resemblance which sometimes leads to their living
disgracefully or honourably, as the case may be;
then there is nationality, for races have their own
character, and the same action is not probable in the
case of a barbarian, a Roman and a Greek;

is another, for there is a like diversity in the laws,
institutions and opinions of different states; sex,
since for example a man is more likely to commit a
robbery, a woman to poison; age, since different
actions suit different ages; education and training,
since it makes a great difference who were the instructors and what the method of instruction in each
individual case;

often introduced as an argument for lust, strength as
an argument for insolence, and their opposites for
opposite conduct; fortune, since the same acts are
not to be expected from rich and poor, or from one
who is surrounded by troops of relations, friends or
clients and one who lacks all these advantages;
condition, too, is important, for it makes a great
difference whether a man be famous or obscure, a
magistrate or a private individual, a father or a son,
a citizen or a foreigner, a free man or a slave,
married or unmarried, a father or childless.
                    <milestone n="27" unit="section"/>
                    Nor
must we pass by natural disposition, for avarice,
anger, pity, cruelty, severity and the like may often
be adduced to prove the credibility or the reverse of
a given act; it is for instance often asked whether a

                    man's way of living be luxurious, frugal or parsimonious. Then there is occupation, since a rustic, a

all perform very different actions.

                    We must also
consider the personal ambitions of individuals, for
instance whether they wish to be thought rich or
eloquent, just or powerful. Past life and previous
utterances are also a subject for investigation, since
we are in the habit of inferring the present from the
past. To these some add passion, by which they
mean some temporary emotion such as anger or fear;
they also add design, which may refer to the past,
                    <milestone n="29" unit="section"/>
                    present or future. These latter, however, although
accidents of persons, should be referred to that class
of arguments which we draw from causes, as also
should certain dispositions of mind, for example
when we inquire whether one man is the friend or
enemy of another.

accidents of persons; this is perfectly true, but names
are rarely food for argument, unless indeed they
have been given for some special reasons, such as the
titles of Wise, Great, Pious, or unless the name has
suggested some special thought to the bearer.

                    I now pass to things: of these actions are the most
nearly connected with persons and must therefore be
treated first. In regard to every action the question
arises either Why or Where or When or How or By
what means the action is performed.
                    <milestone n="33" unit="section"/>
                    Consequently
arguments are drawn from the causes of past or future
actions. The matter of these causes, by some called

                    falls into two genera, which
are each divided into four species. For the motive
for any action is as a rule concerned with the acquisition, increase, preservation and use of things that are
good or with the avoidance, diminution, endurance
of things that are evil or with escape there from.
All these considerations carry great weight in deliberative oratory as well.
                    <milestone n="34" unit="section"/>
                    But right actions have
right motives, while evil actions are the result of
false opinions, which originate in the things which
men believe to be good or evil. Hence spring errors
and evil passions such as anger, hatred, envy, desire,
hope, ambition, audacity, fear and others of a similar
kind. To these accidental circumstances may often
be added, such as drunkenness or ignorance, which
serve sometimes to excuse and sometimes to prove
a charge, as for instance when a man is said to have
killed one person while lying in wait for another.
Further,
                    <milestone n="35" unit="section"/>
                    motives are often discussed not merely to
convict the accused of the offence with which he is
charged, but also to defend him when he contends
                    <pb xml:id="p.221"/>
                    that his action was right, that is to say proceeded
from an honourable motive, a theme of which I have
spoken more fully in the third book.

                    Questions
of definition are also at times intimately connected
with motives. Is a man a tyrannicide if he kills a
tyrant by whom he has been detected in the act
of adultery? Or is lie guilty of sacrilege who tore
down arms dedicated in a temple to enable him to
drive the enemy from the city?
                    <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>
                    Arguments are also
drawn from place. With a view to proving our facts
we consider such questions as whether a place is hilly
or level, near the coast or inland, planted or uncultivated, crowded or deserted, near or far, suitable for
carrying out a given design or the reverse. This is a
topic which is treated most carefully by Cicero in his
                    <hi rend="italic">pro Milone.</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    These points and the like generally
refer to questions of fact, but occasionally to
questions of law as well. For we may ask whether
a place is public or private, sacred or profane, our
own or another's, just as where persons are concerned
we ask whether a man is a magistrate, a father, a
foreigner.
                    <milestone n="39" unit="section"/>
                    Hence arise such questions as the following.

                    But such points afford matter for
argument when there is a controversy as to the
facts, and matter for enquiry when the dispute
turns on a point of law. Place also frequently

is not always lawful or seemly under all circumstances, while it makes considerable difference in
what state the enquiry is taking place, for they differ
both in custom and law.

                    Further arguments drawn
from place may serve to secure approval or the
reverse. Ajax for instance in Ovid

by the Trojans. The dispute as to whether the arms of
Achilles should be awarded to him or to Ulysses is being
tried there. Ajax's argument is,

                    Such arguments may also carry

from time, which I shall now proceed to discuss.

in two different senses, general and special. The first
sense is seen in words and phrases such as
                    <quote>now,</quote>
                    <quote>formerly,</quote>

                    and whenever we speak
of past, present or future. The second sense occurs
when we speak either of definite periods of time
such as
                    <quote>in summer,</quote>
                    <quote>in winter,</quote>

                    Certain Latin writers have thought it a sufficient

                    <quote>time,</quote>
                    and the

                    In both senses time is of importance

                    Further, all kinds of

                    Some writers have shown themselves

                    to an act. As regards subsequent circumstances I may cite accusations such as
                    <quote>You hid yourself, you fled, livid spots and swellings appeared on the corpse.</quote>
                    The counsel for the defence will
employ the same divisions of time to discredit the
charge which is brought against him.
                    <milestone n="47" unit="section"/>
                    In these
considerations are included everything in connexion
with words and deeds, but in two distinct ways.
For some things are done because something else is
like to follow, and others because something else
has previously been done, as for instance, when the
husband of a beautiful woman is accused of having
acted as a procurer on the ground that he bought
her after she was found guilty of adultery, or
when a debauched character is accused of parricide on the ground that he said to his father
                    <quote>You have rebuked me for the last time.</quote>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    in the former case the accused is not a procurer
because he bought the woman, but bought her
because he was a procurer, while in the latter the
accused is not a parricide because he used these
words, but used them because lie intended to kill his
father.
                    <milestone n="48" unit="section"/>
                    With regard to accidental circumstances,
which also provide matter for arguments, these
clearly belong to subsequent time, but are distinguished by a certain special quality, as for instance if
I should say,
                    <quote>Scipio was a better general than Hannibal, for he conquered Hannibal</quote>
                    ;

                    ;
                    <quote>He was a good farmer, for he gathered in huge harvests</quote>
                    ;
or referring to bad qualities,
                    <quote>He was a prodigal, for he squandered his patrimony</quote>
                    ;

                    <milestone n="49" unit="section"/>
                    We must also
consider the resources possessed by the parties
concerned, more especially when dealing with questions of fact; for it is more credible that a smaller
number of persons were killed by a larger, a weaker
party by a stronger, sleepers by men that were wide
awake, the unsuspecting by the well-prepared, while
the converse arguments may be used to prove the
opposite.

                    Such considerations arise both in deliberative and forensic oratory: in the latter they occur
in relation to two questions, namely, whether some
given person had the will, and whether lie had the
power to do the deed; for hope will often create
the will to act. Hence the well-known inference in
Cicero:

nature and meaning of an act, and which can be
considered by themselves apart from all considerations of persons and all else that gives rise to the
actual cause, there are clearly three points to which
we must give attention, namely Whether it is, What

                    Definition is of two

A

                    is that which happens to one particular
object and that alone; speech and laughter for
instance are
                    <hi rend="italic">properties</hi>
                    of man. Or it may be something specially belonging to an object, but not to it
alone; heating for instance is a

                    of fire. The

                    <hi rend="italic">property</hi>
                    in a definition
will impair it, but the introduction of a
                    <hi rend="italic">property,</hi>
                    whatever it may be, will not necessarily establish a
definition.

that the peculiar

tyrants, we should deny it: for an executioner is not

                    a tyrannicide, if he executes a tyrant who
has been delivered to him for the purpose, nor again
is he a tyrannicide who kills a tyrant unwittingly or
against his will.

                    it is, for instance, one thing to be a slave,
and another to be in a state of servitude; hence the
distinction raised in connexion with persons assigned
to their creditors for debt:
                    <hi rend="italic">
                        A slave, if he is manumitted becomes a freedman, but this is not the case with
one who is assigned.

                    There are also other points of
difference which are dealt with elsewhere.

                    Again,
the term difference is applied in cases when the

                    <hi rend="italic">species</hi>
                    and one
                    <hi rend="italic">species</hi>
                    is subdivided. Animal, for instance, is a genus, mortal a

                    the difference between such animals and quadrupeds
or creatures of the sea. This distinction, however,
comes under the province not so much of argument
as of exact definition. Cicero

would base his claim upon

                    By the elimination
of the previous suppositions he is shown to belong to
another. This form of argument is risky and must
be employed with care; for if, in setting forth the
alternatives, we chance to omit one, our whole case
will fail, and our audience will be moved to laughter.

                    As there are three divisions of time, so the order
of events falls into three stages. For everything has a
beginning, growth and consummation, as for instance
                    <pb xml:id="p.241"/>
                    a quarrel, blows, murder. Thus arise arguments which
lend each other mutual support; for the conclusion
is inferred from the beginnings, as in the following
case:

                    ; or the
beginning may be inferred from the conclusion:
for instance the fact that Sulla resigned the dictatorship is an argument that Sulla did not take up
arms with the intention of establishing a tyranny.

                    Similarly from the growth of a situation we may

questions of fact but as regards points of equity,
such as whether the conclusion is referable to the
beginning, that is,

                    There is another very similar form of argument,
which consists in the inference of facts from their
efficient causes or the reverse, a process known as
argument from causes. The conclusion is sometimes
necessary, sometimes generally without being necessarily true. For instance, a body casts a shadow in
the light, and the shadow wherever it falls indicates
the presence of a body.

                    There are other conclusions

                        everyone that is coloured receives that colour from
the sun; a journey makes the traveller dusty, but
every journey does not produce dust, nor is everyone

of necessary conclusions on the other hand I may
cite the following:
                    <quote>If wisdom makes a man good, a good man must needs be wise</quote>
                    ; and again,
                    <quote>It is the part of a good man to act honourably, of a bad man to act dishonourably,</quote>

                        Those who act
honourably are considered good, those who act dishonourably are considered bad men.
                    </quote>
                    In these
cases the conclusion is correct. On the other hand,
                    <quote>
                        though exercise generally makes the body robust,
not everyone who is robust is given to exercise, nor
is everyone that is addicted to exercise robust. Nor
again, because courage prevents our fearing death, is
every man who has no fear of death to be regarded
as a brave man; nor is the sun useless to man
because it sometimes gives him a headache.

                    Such in the main are the usual topics of proof
as specified by teachers of rhetoric, but it is not
sufficient to classify them generically in our instructions, since from each of them there arises an infinite
number of arguments, while it is in the very nature
of things impossible to deal with all their individual
species. Those who have attempted to perform
this latter task have exposed themselves in equal
degree to two disadvantages, saying too much and
yet failing to cover the whole ground.

so he who has learned that arguments must be
drawn from antecedent, contemporary or subsequent facts will not be sufficiently instructed in

                    no connexion with any other dispute, and therefore

who refuses to defend his father when accused of

denies that he is liable to this penalty unless his
father is acquitted. How does he support this contention? There is another law to the effect that a

as to what argument should be put forward requires
no less care than the consideration of the manner in
which we are to prove that which we have put
forward. Indeed in this connexion invention, if
not the most important, is certainly the first consideration. For, just as weapons are superfluous
for one who does not know what his target is, so
too arguments are useless, unless you see in advance
to what they are to be applied. This is a task for

                        When Alexander destroyed Thebes, he
found documents showing that the Thebans had
lent a hundred talents to the Thessalians. These
documents he presented to the Thessalians as a
reward for the assistance they had given him in the
campaign. Subsequently the Thebans, after the
restoration of their city by Cassander, demanded
that the Thessalians should repay the money.

                    The
case is tried before the Amphictyonic council. It is
admitted that the Thebans lent the money and
were not repaid.
                    <milestone n="112" unit="section"/>
                    The whole dispute turns on the
allegation that Alexander had excused the Thessalians from payment of the debt. It is also admitted
that the Thessalians had received no money from
Alexander. The question is therefore whether his
gift is equivalent to his having given them money.
                    <milestone n="113" unit="section"/>
                    What use will formal topics of argument be in such
a case, unless I first convince myself that the gift of
Alexander made no difference, that he had not the
power to make it, and that he did not make it?
The opening of the Thebans' plea presents no
difficulty and is likely to win the approval of the
judges, since they are seeking to recover by right
what was taken from them by force. But out of this
point arises a violent controversy as to the right of
war, since the Thessalians urge that kingdoms and
peoples and the frontiers of nations and cities
depend upon these rights.
                    <milestone n="114" unit="section"/>
                    To meet this argument
                    <pb xml:id="p.265"/>
                    it is necessary to discover in what respect this case
differs from others which are concerned with property that has fallen into the hands of the victor:
the difficulty moreover lies not so much in the
proof as in the way it should be put forward. We
may begin by stating that the rights of war do not
hold good in any matter which can be brought
before a court of justice, and that what is taken
by force of arms can only be retained by force of
arms, and consequently, wherever the rights of war
hold good, there is no room for the functions of
a judge, while on the contrary where the functions
of the judge come into play, the rights of war cease
to have any force.
                    <milestone n="115" unit="section"/>
                    The reason why it is necessary
to discover this principle is to enable us to bring
the following argument into play: that prisoners of
war are free on returning to their native land just
because the gains of war cannot be retained except
by the exercise of the same violence by which they
were acquired. Another peculiar feature of the case
is that it is tried before the Amphictyonic council,
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

represented.

                    and you will remember that we have to employ
different methods in pleading a case before the
centumviral court and before an arbitrator, though
the problems of the cases may be identical.
                    <milestone n="116" unit="section"/>
                    Secondly
we may urge that the right to refuse payment could
not have been conferred by the victor because he
possesses only what he holds, but a right, being
incorporeal, cannot be grasped by the hand.
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi>
                        a right can only be transferred by the possessor, not
by force or seizure.
                    </note>
                    It is
more difficult to discover this principle than, once
discovered, to defend it with arguments such as
that the position of an heir and a conqueror are
fundamentally different, since right passes to the
one and property to the other.
                    <milestone n="117" unit="section"/>
                    It is further an
                    <pb xml:id="p.267"/>
                    argument peculiar to the subject matter of the case
that the right over a public debt could not have
passed to the victor, because the repayment of a
sum of money lent by a whole people is due to them
all, and as long as any single one of them survives,
he is creditor for the whole amount: but the
Thebans were never all of them to a man in Alexander's power.
                    <milestone n="118" unit="section"/>
                    The force of this argument resides
in the fact that it is not based on any external
support, but holds good in itself. Proceeding to
the third line of argument we may note that the
first portion of it is of a more ordinary type, namely
that the right to repayment is not based on the
actual document, a plea which can be supported
by many arguments. Doubt may also be thrown on
Alexander's purpose: did he intend to honour them
or to trick them? Another argument peculiar to
the subject (indeed it practically introduces a new
discussion) is that the Thebans may be regarded as
having in virtue of their restoration recovered the
right even though it be admitted that they had lost
it. Again Cassander's purpose may be discussed,
but, as the case is being pleaded before the Amphictyonic council, we shall find that the most powerful
plea that can be urged is that of equity.

                    For the discovery of arguments was not
the result of the publication of text-books, but every
kind of argument was put forward before any rules
were laid down, and it was only later that writers
of rhetoric noted them and collected them for publication. A proof of this is the fact that the examples which they use are old and quoted from the
orators, while they themselves discover nothing new
or that has not been said before.

                    The creators of
the art were therefore the orators, though we owe
a debt of gratitude also to those who have given us
a short cut to knowledge. For thanks to them the
arguments discovered by the genius of earlier orators
have not got to be hunted out and noted down in
detail. But this does not suffice to make an orator
any more than it suffices to learn the art of gymnastic
in school: the body must be assisted by continual
practice, self control, diet and above all by nature;
on the other hand none of these are sufficient in
themselves without the aid of art.

                    I would also
have students of oratory consider that all the forms
of argument which I have just set forth cannot be
found in every case, and that when the subject on
which we have to speak has been propounded, it is
no use considering each separate type of argument
and knocking at the door of each with a view to
discovering whether they may chance to serve to
prove our point, except while we are in the position
of mere learners without any knowledge of actual
practice.

                    Such a proceeding merely retards the

                    <pb xml:id="p.271"/>
                    argument and thus learn by experiment what is apt
and suitable to our case. In fact I am not sure that
it will not be an actual obstacle to progress unless
a certain innate penetration and a power of rapid
divination seconded by study lead us straight to the
arguments which suit our case.

                    For just as the
melody of the voice is most pleasing when accompanied by the lyre, yet if the musician's hand be
slow and, unless he first look at the strings and
take their measure, hesitate as to which strings
match the several notes of the voice, it would
be better that he should content himself with the
natural music of the voice unaccompanied by any
instrument; even so our theory of speaking must be
adapted and, like the lyre, attuned to such rules as
these.
                    <milestone n="125" unit="section"/>
                    But it is only by constant practice that we
can secure that, just as the hands of the musician,
even though his eyes be turned elsewhere, produce
bass, treble or intermediate notes by force of habit,
so the thought of the orator should suffer no delay
owing to the variety and number of possible arguments, but that the latter should present themselves
uncalled and, just as letters and syllables require no
thought on the part of a writer, so arguments should
spontaneously follow the thought of the orator.

conclusion of the problem under discussion from its
resemblance to the points already conceded. This
method is known as induction, and though it

                    Arguments from unlikes are most useful in exhortation. Courage is more remarkable in a woman
than in a man. Therefore, if we wish to kindle
someone's ambition to the performance of heroic
deeds, we shall find that parallels drawn from
the cases of Horatius and Torquatus will carry
less weight than that of the woman by whose
hand Pyrrhus was slain, and if we wish to urge
a man to meet death, the cases of Cato and
Scipio will carry less weight than that of
Lucretia. These are however arguments from the
greater to the less.

cites his own case to support his argument.

thus? It is Rome itself, the city whose first trial
on a capital charge was that of Marcus Horatius,

which, although they did not originate with Aesop
(for Hesiod seems to have been the first to write

less suspicious than others in their reception of

                    <quote>
                        <hi rend="italic">As</hi>

are useless without a steersman, so soldiers are useless without a general.

                    Still it is always possible
to be misled by appearances in the use of simile,
and we must therefore use our judgment in their
employment. For though a new ship is more useful
than one which is old, this simile will not apply to
friendship: and again, though we praise one who is
liberal with her money, we do not praise one who
is liberal with her embraces. In these cases there is
similitude in the epithets
                    <hi rend="italic">old</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italic">liberal,</hi>
                    but their
force is different, when applied to ships and friendship, money and embraces.

                    Consequently, it is allimportant in this connexion to consider whether the
simile is really applicable. So in answering those

                    At this the wife of
Xenophon not unnaturally blushed; for she had
answered ill in replying that she would prefer her
neighbour's gold ornaments to her own, since it
would be wrong to do so. If on the other hand she
had replied that she would prefer her ornaments to
be of the same quality as those of her neighbour, she
might have answered without putting herself to the

him who was his superior in virtue.

                    It is more important for our purpose to note that
arguments may be drawn from similar, opposite, and
dissimilar points of law. As an example of the first,
take the following passage from the

                    where he argues that a man to whom the
usufruct of a house has been left will not restore it
in the interests of the heir if it collapses; just as
lie would not replace a slave if he should die. The
following will provide an example of an argument
drawn from opposite points of law:
                    <quote>
                        The absence
of a formal contract is no bar to the legality of
a marriage, provided the parties cohabit by mutual

count for nothing in the absence of such mutual
consent.

                    An instance of an argument drawn from

                        It is not the same thing for the master of the

                    even common sayings and popular beliefs may

pity not merely as an emotion, but even as a god.

Wise Men as so many rules of life? If an adulteress is on her trial for poisoning, is she not already
to be regarded as condemned by the judgment of
Marcus Cato, who asserted that every adulteress
was as good as a poisoner? As for reflexions drawn
from the poets, not only speeches, but even the
works of the philosophers, are full of them; for
although the philosophers think everything inferior to their own precepts and writings, they
have not thought it beneath their dignity to
quote numbers of lines from the poets to lend
authority to their statements.

                    rank it above all other authorities. Such authority
is rare, but may prove useful. It is employed by
Cicero in his speech on the Replies of the Soothsayers

Cicero argued against this in a speech to the senate (56 B.C.).

his whole case turn on this point, and if his contention is disproved, he will he unable to make a

anger was the motive, we must show the sway that
this passion has over the minds of men. Thus our
arguments will not only be strengthened, but will
be more ornamental as well, since we shall have

be true, whereas counsel for the defence may deny

                    Moreover the prosecutor generally produces a speech
which he has prepared at home, while the counsel
for the defence has frequently to deal with quite
unexpected points. The prosecutor brings forward
his witnesses, while counsel for the defence has to
refute the charge by arguments drawn from the case
itself. The prosecutor draws his material from the
odium excited by the charges, even though it have
no justification, denouncing parricide, sacrilege, or
treason, whereas counsel for the defence can only
deny them. Consequently quite moderate speakers
have proved adequate in prosecution, while no one
can be a good counsel for the defence unless he
possesses real eloquence. In a word, it is just so
much easier to accuse than to defend as it is easier
to inflict than to heal a wound.

client has committed an offence that deserves the
death penalty, it is still the duty of a merciful judge
to spare him despite his sins, it must be noted in
the first place that we have to deal, not with our
adversary, but with the judge, and secondly that we

than confession of guilt. When denial and justification are both impossible, we must as a last resort
base our defence on the legal point of competence.

                    In this case
there is no ground for dispute. Consequently I regard as the height of folly the advice that is given
in such cases, that what cannot be defended should

the point in question is that on which the judge has
to give his decision.

                    On the other hand, if the

more than accessory, I should prefer simply to state
that it has nothing to do with the question at issue,
that it is not worth our attention, and that it has not
the importance given to it by our opponent, though
in such a case I should be prepared to pardon a
policy of ignoring the charge such as I have just
mentioned. For a good advocate ought not to be
afraid of incurring a trivial censure for negligence,
if such apparent negligence is likely to save his

                    or dispose
of them singly. We shall adopt the former course
if the arguments are so weak that they can be overthrown simultaneously, or so embarrassing that it

Sometimes,

                    if it is difficult to refute the statements
made by our opponents, we may compare our arguments with theirs, at least if by such a procedure it
is possible to prove the superiority of our own. On
the other hand, those arguments which rely on their
cumulative force must be analysed individually, as
for example in the case which I cited above:

                    The cumulative force of these arguments is damaging. But if you refute them singly, the flame
which derived its strength from the mass of fuel will
die down as soon as the material which fed it is
separated, just as if we divert a great stream into a
number of channels we may cross it where we will.
We shall therefore adapt our method of refutation
to the exigencies of our case, now dealing with individual arguments and now treating them in bulk.
                    <milestone n="14" unit="section"/>
                    For at times we may include in a single proposition
the refutation of an argument which our opponent
has constructed of a number of different points.
For instance, if the accuser allege that the accused
had a number of motives for committing a crime,
we may make a general denial of the fact without
dealing singly with each alleged motive, because the
fact that a man has had a motive for committing a
                    <pb xml:id="p.321"/>
                    crime does not prove that he has actually committed
it.

                    It will however as a rule be expedient for the
prosecution to employ massed arguments, and for
the accused to refute them in detail.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We must, however, also consider the manner in
which we should refute the arguments of our
opponent. If his statements be obviously false, it
will be sufficient to deny them. This is done by
Cicero in the
                    <hi rend="italic">pro Cluentio,</hi>
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">lx. 168.</note>

the man alleged by the accuser to have fallen dead
on the spot after drinking the contents of the cup,
died on the same day.
                    <milestone n="16" unit="section"/>
                    Again, it requires no skill
to rebut arguments which are obviously contradictory, superfluous or foolish, and consequently I
need give no examples nor instructions as to the
method to be employed. There is also the type
of charge which is known as obscure, where it is
alleged that an act was committed in secret without
witnesses or any evidence to prove it: this suffers
from an inherent weakness, since the fact that our
opponent can produce no proof is sufficient for our
purpose: the same applies to arguments which are
irrelevant to the case.
                    <milestone n="17" unit="section"/>
                    It is, however, sometimes an
orator's duty to make it appear that some argument
of his opponent is contradictory or irrelevant or
incredible or superfluous or really favourable to his
own client. Oppius

                    is charged with having embezzled the supplies intended to feed the troops.
It is a serious charge, but Cicero shows that it
contradicts other charges, since the same accusers
also charged Oppius with desiring to corrupt the
army by bribes.

to be entrusted with the task of accusing Verres on

                    As regards other charges, they may all be
dealt with by very similar methods. For they may
be demolished either by conjecture, when we shall
consider whether they are true, by definition, when
we shall examine whether they are relevant to the
case, by quality, when we shall consider whether
they are dishonourable, unfair, scandalous, inhuman,
cruel, or deserve any other epithet coming under
the head of quality.

                    Such questions have to be
considered, not merely in connection with the statement of the charges or the reasons alleged, but with
reference to the nature of the case in its entirety.
For instance, the question of cruelty is considered
with regard to the charge of high treason brought

                    Similarly, it may be shown that
charges are hasty, insidious or vindictive. The
strongest argument, however, which can be brought
against a charge is that it involves peril to the
community or to the judges themselves; we find an
example of the former in the

                    On the other
hand there are certain arguments which at times
may best be treated with contempt, as being trivial

Cicero, indeed this affectation of indifference is sometimes carried so far that we trample disdainfully
under foot arguments which we should never succeed in refuting by counter-argument.

                    Since, however, the majority of such arguments
are based on similarity, we must make diligent
search to discover if any discrepancy is to be found
in what is put forward. It is easy to do this where
points of law are concerned. For the law was drafted
to cover cases quite other than the present, and
consequently it is all the easier to show the difference
between case and case. As to parallels drawn from
dumb animals or inanimate objects, they are easy to
make light of.

                    Examples drawn from facts, if damaging to our case, must be treated in various ways: if
they are ancient history, we may call them legendary,
while if they are undoubted, we may lay stress on
their extreme dissimilarity. For it is impossible for
two cases to be alike in every detail. For instance,
if the case of Ahala,2 by whom Maelius was killed,
is quoted to justify Nasica for the slaying of Tiberius
Gracchus, we may argue that Maelius was endeavouring to make himself king, while all that Gracchus
had done was to bring forward laws in the interest
of the people, and that while Ahala was Master of
the Horse, Nasica was a private citizen. In the last
resort, if all else prove unavailing, we must see if
                    <pb xml:id="p.327"/>
                    we can show that the action adduced as a parallel
was itself unjustifiable. These remarks as to examples apply also to previous decisions in the courts.

                    With regard to my statement that the manner in
which the accuser stated his charges was of importance, I would point out in this connexion that if
he has spoken but feebly, we may repeat his actual
words; while, if he has used bitter and violent
language, we may restate the facts in milder terms,
as Cicero does in the

statement by our opponent will give us an opportunity of demolishing his arguments. This is
specially likely to occur with speakers who have a
passion for producing impressive thoughts: for the
temptation to air their eloquence is such that they
take no heed of what they have said already, being
absorbed by the topic immediately before them to
the detriment of the interests of the case as a
whole.

                    What is there likely to tell so heavily
against Cluentius as the stigma inflicted by the

                        But, Attius, I
would urge you to give the closest consideration to
the following problem. Which do you desire to carry
the greater weight—the judgment of the censors, or
of Egnatius? If the latter, you regard the judgment of the censors in other cases as counting for
little, since they expelled this same Gnaeus Egnatius, on whose authority you lay such stress, from
his place in the senate. On the other hand, if you
attach most weight to the judgment of the censors,
I must point out that the censors retained the
younger Egnatius, whom his father disinherited by
an act resembling a censorial decision, in his position
as senator, although they had expelled his father.

                    shown in their commission is out of all proportion to
the skill required to deal with them: I refer to
mistakes such as advancing a disputable argument
as indisputable, a controversial point as admitted, a
point common to a number of cases as peculiar to
the case in hand, or the employment of trite,
superfluous, or incredible arguments. For careless
speakers are liable to commit a host of errors: they
will exaggerate a charge which has still got to be
proved, will argue about an act when the question is
who committed it, will attempt impossibilities, drop
an argument as if it were complete, whereas it is
scarcely begun, speak of the individual in preference
to the case,
                    <milestone n="35" unit="section"/>
                    and attribute personal faults to circumstances, as for instance if a speaker should attack the
decemvirate instead of Appius. They will also contradict what is obvious, speak ambiguously, lose
sight of the main issue of the case, or give replies
which have no relation to the charges made. This
latter procedure may, it is true, be occasionally employed when we have a bad case which requires to
be supported by arguments drawn from matters
foreign to the case. The trial of Verres provides an
example; when accused of peculation it was alleged
that he had shown courage and energy in his defence
of Sicily against the pirates.

                    The same rules apply to objections which we may
have to meet. But there is one point which requires
special attention, since in such cases many speakers
fall into two very different faults. For some even
in the courts will pass by such objections when
raised by their opponents as troublesome and vexatious details, and, contenting themselves with the
arguments which they have brought ready-made
                    <pb xml:id="p.335"/>
                    from their study, will speak as if their opponent did
not exist. This error is of course far more common
in the schools, for there objections are not merely
disregarded, but the subjects for declamation are
generally framed in such a way that there is nothing
to be said on the opposite side.
                    <milestone n="37" unit="section"/>
                    On the other hand
there are some who surfer from excess of zeal,
and think it their duty to reply to every word
and even every trifling reflexion, a task which is
at once endless and superfluous. For it is not the
case. but the pleader, whom they are refuting. Personally I should always prefer that a speaker should
reveal his eloquence in such a way that, if what he
says advances his case, the credit will be given to his
talent and not to the nature of his case, while if
what he says damages his case the blame will attach
to the case and not to his powers.

                    The method of reply
to our opponent's counsel should be on different
lines. Sometimes however we are justified in attacking, not merely their manner of speaking, but
also their character, their appearance, their gait or
bearing. Indeed, in his attack on Quintius, Cicero

                    does not confine himself to these topics, but even
attacks his purple-bordered toga that goes trailing
to his heels: for Quintius had caused Cluentius grave

                    embarrassment by his turbulent harangues.

                    Sometimes, in order to dispel the unpopularity excited by
bitter criticism, the latter may be disposed of by a
jest, as for example Cicero disposes of Triarius.
For to the allegation that the pillars destined for the
house of Scaurus were carried on waggons through

                    Such tactics are more readily allowed
against an accuser, for the duties of counsel for the
defence sometimes force him to make such personal
attacks.

                    On the other hand there is no objection to
complaining of the conduct of the advocates on
either side, so long as our complaint follows accepted
practice and does not overstep the limits imposed by
good manners; I refer to complaints such as that
our opponents have abridged, obscured or postponed

                    It is however necessary to issue a special warning
to declaimers that they should not put forward
objections that can easily be met or assume that
their opponent is a fool. As it is, owing to our
tendency to think that the subject-matter of our
speech may be drawn from our own fancy, florid
commonplaces and epigrams designed to bring down
the house occur to our minds with the utmost
                    <pb xml:id="p.339"/>
                    readiness, with the result that we should do well to
bear in mind the lines:

                    But such a practice will be fatal in the courts,
where we have to answer our opponent and not
ourselves. It is said that Accius, when asked why
he did not turn advocate in view of the extraordinary
skill in making apt replies which his tragedies
revealed, replied that in his plays the characters said
what he himself wanted them to say, whereas in the
courts his adversaries would probably say just what
he least wanted them to say.

                    It is therefore
ridiculous in exercises which prepare the student
for the actual courts to consider what answer can be
made before ever giving a thought to what the
opposing counsel is likely to say. And a good teacher
should commend a pupil no less for his skill in
thinking out arguments that may be put forward
for the opposite side than in discovering arguments
to prove his own case.
                    <milestone n="45" unit="section"/>
                    Again, there is another
practice which is always permissible in the schools,
but rarely in the courts. For when we speak first
as claimants in a real case, how can we raise objections, seeing that our opponent has so far said
nothing?
                    <milestone n="46" unit="section"/>
                    Still, many fall into this error either
because they have acquired the habit in declamation
or simply owing to a passion for hearing their own
voice, thereby affording fine sport to those who
reply: for sometimes the latter will remark sarcastically that they never said anything of the kind and
have no intention of saying anything so idiotic, and
sometimes that they are grateful for the admirable

                    warnings so kindly given by their opponent: but
most often they will say, and this is the strongest
line that they can take, that their opponent would
never have replied to objections which had never
been raised had he not realised that these objections
were justified and been driven to admit it by his
consciousness of the fact.

                    not content with raising
imaginary objections, develop whole passages on such
themes, saying that they know their opponents will
say this and will proceed to argue thus and thus. I
remember that Vibius Crispus in our own day disposed of this practice very neatly, for he was a
humorous fellow with a very pretty wit:

                    Sometimes however it may be possible to put forward something not unlike such objections, if some

                    are in a position to state certain definite objections
which are absolutely essential to our opponent's case:
for instance, if stolen goods have been discovered
in a house, the accused must of necessity allege
either that they were brought there without his
knowledge or deposited with him or given to him
and we may therefore answer all these points even
although they have not been put forward.

                    On the
other hand, in the schools we are quite justified in
answering both statements and imaginary objections; for by these means we shall train ourselves

second. Unless we do this, we shall have no chance

                    There is another serious fault into which pleaders
fall: the anxious over-elaboration of points. Such
a procedure makes his case suspect to the judges,
while frequently arguments which, if stated without
more ado, would have removed all doubt, lose their
force owing to the delay caused by the elaborate
preparations made for their introduction, due to the
tact that the advocate thinks that they require
additional support. Our orator must therefore adopt
a confident manner, and should always speak as if he
thought his case admirable. This quality, like all
other good qualities, is particularly evident in Cicero.

proof. Further, the advocate who knows what are
the strongest points in his own and his opponent's

                    Nay, I am not sure that this form of proof is not
actually of more frequent occurrence when something is denied. It is, however, specially important
for both parties that they should see where the
main issue lies. For it often happens that the points
raised in pleading are many, although those on

and refutation, but they require to be embellished
and supported by the powers of the speaker. For
although our arguments may be admirably adapted
to express what we desire, they will none the less

effort to give them life.

                    commonplaces on the subject of witnesses, documentary
evidence, arguments and the like make a great
impression on the minds of the judges, as also do
those topics which are peculiar to the case, those I
mean in which we praise or blame any action or
show that it is just or unjust, or make it seem more
or less important or more or less harsh than it
really is. Of these topics some are adapted to the
comparison of individual arguments, others to the

schools as to whether such commonplaces should be
applied to individual questions (which is the view of
Theodorus), or whether the judge should be instructed in the facts before any appeal is made to
his feelings (the latter being the view of Apollodorus), as though no middle course were possible and
no regard were to be had to the exigencies of the

                    As regards the
                    <hi rend="italic">epicheieme,</hi>
                    some authorities hold
that it consists of four, five, and even six parts.
Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">
                        <hi rend="italic">de Inv.</hi>
                        I. xxxvii. 67.
                    </note>
                    urges that there are not more than five at
most, i.e. the major premise and its reason, the minor
premise and its proof, and fifthly the conclusion.
But since at times the major premise does not
require a reason nor the minor a proof, while
occasionally even the conclusion is not necessary,
he holds that the
                    <hi rend="italic">epicheireme</hi>
                    may consist of only
four, three, or even two parts.
                    <milestone n="6" unit="section"/>
                    Personally however
follow the majority of authorities in holding that
there are not more than three parts. For it follows
from the very nature of reasoning that there must
be something to form the subject of enquiry and
something else to provide the proof, while the third
element which has to be added may be regarded
as resulting from the agreement of the two previous
                    <pb xml:id="p.353"/>
                    elements. Thus the first part will be the major, the
second the minor premise and the third the conclusion. For the confirmation and development of
both premises may reasonably be included in the
parts to which they belong.

                    Let us then take
an example from Cicero
                    <note anchored="true" place="unspecified">

                    This they call the first part and consider that
it requires to be established by various reasons and
a copious display of eloquence. Personally I hold
that the whole of this together with its reason forms
but one part. Otherwise, if the
                    <hi rend="italic">reason</hi>
                    is to be treated
as a separate part and if there are a variety of
                    <hi rend="italic">reasons,</hi>
                    this will involve an addition to the number
of parts. Next he produces the

                    The proof of this minor premise is
treated as the fourth part of the
                    <hi rend="italic">epicheireme.</hi>
                    My
criticism of this statement is identical with my
criticism of the preceding.

                    The fifth place they
assign to the conclusion which either merely makes
the necessary inference from the preceding parts
(

                    <quote>Therefore the universe is governed by reason</quote>

together adds what is deduced from them with the
following result:

                        But if on the one hand things
that are controlled by reason are better governed

follows that the universe is governed by reason.

are justified in killing one who lies in wait for us;

he were an enemy: therefore Milo was justified in
killing Clodius as an enemy.

                    The conclusion is not
valid, since we have not yet proved that Clodius lay
in wait for him But the conclusion that we are
therefore justified in killing one who lies in wait
for us is perfectly true, though irrelevant to the

for Milo.

                    I think I have now dealt with all the precepts of

still leave scope for free exercise of the judgment.
For although I consider that there are occasions
                    <pb xml:id="p.365"/>
                    when the orator may lawfully employ the syllogism, I
am far from desiring him to make his whole speech

                    <hi rend="italic">epicheiremes</hi>
                    and
                    <hi rend="italic">enthymemes.</hi>
                    For a speech of that
character would resemble dialogues and dialectical
controversies rather than pleadings of the kind with
which we are concerned, and there is an enormous
difference between the two.

                    For in the former we
are confronted with learned men seeking for truth
among men of learning; consequently they subject
everything to a minute and scrupulous inquiry with
a view to arriving at clear and convincing truths,
and they claim for themselves the tasks of invention
and judgment, calling the former
                    <foreign xml:lang="grc">topikh/</foreign>
                    or the

                    We on the other hand have to compose our
speeches for others to judge, and have frequently
to speak before an audience of men who, if not
thoroughly ill-educated, are certainly ignorant of
such arts as dialectic: and unless we attract them
by the charm of our discourse or drag them by its
force, and occasionally throw them off their balance
by an appeal to their emotions, we shall be unable
to vindicate the claims of truth and justice.

                    Eloquence aims at being rich, beautiful and commanding,

boredom.

Even in Demosthenes we find but few traces of such
a mechanism. And yet the Greeks of to-day are even
more prone than we are (though this is the only
point in which their practice is worse than ours) to
bind their thoughts in fetters and to connect them
by an inexorable chain of argument, making inferences where there was never any doubt, proving admitted facts and asserting that in so doing they are
following the orators of old, although they always
refuse to answer the question who it is that they are
imitating. However of figures I shall speak elsewhere.

all elevation and ornateness. I readily admit that
                    <pb xml:id="p.369"/>

to assert that the word

                    Further, the more unattractive the natural
appearance of anything, the more does it require
to be seasoned by charm of style: moreover, an argument is often less suspect when thus disguised, and
the charm with which it is expressed makes it all the
more convincing to our audience. Unless indeed we
think that Cicero was in error when he introduced
phrases such as the following into an argumentative
passage:
                    <quote>The laws are silent in the midst of arms,</quote>
                    and
                    <quote>A sword is sometimes placed in our hands by the laws themselves.</quote>
                    However, we must be careful
to observe a happy mean in the employment of such
embellishments, so that they may prove a real ornament and not a hindrance.
